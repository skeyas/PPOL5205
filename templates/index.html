On Friday, hundreds of UCLA faculty members\u00a0called on the administration to \"denounce\u00a0in the strongest possible terms any celebrations of Hamas terror attacks and killings,\" and asked the university to hold those \"who directly participate in such incitement\" accountable, using existing rules against incitement to violence. The actions bars them from taking university funds or operating on campus for at least five weeks, though the action will continue if the groups don\u2019t stop breaking school rules, using violent rhetoric and intimidating Jewish students., For instance, Beijing looks to already have signed off on the two key asks from the : nuclear arms-control talks and reestablishment of military-to-military contacts, where the senior leaders of the armed forces of both sides are permitted routine consultations. Hudson Institute senior fellow Rebeccah Heinrichs joins 'FOX &amp; Friends' to discuss President Biden's expected meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Xi gets some rhetorical breathing space that spares him making hard concessions \u2013 like not sending military aid to Russia, cheating on sanctions, or cheerleading for Hamas and Iran.   , Eric Mann, the former Weatherman terrorist who recruited  at the age of 17 to train her into Marxism, later\u00a0added: \"Given the social formation of the U.S. as a settler state based on virulent white supremacy, the racialization of all aspects of political life operates as a material force in itself.\" A few months later, Marx wrote, more ominously, \"There is only one way in which the murderous death agonies of the old society and the bloody birth throes of the new society can be shortened, simplified and concentrated, and that way is revolutionary terror.\" In the economic sphere, buyer and seller haggle over a price (or in most cases, millions of buyers and sellers known abstractly as \"the market\" do) to come up with a \"market-clearing price\" that allows buyer and seller to walk away with some measure of satisfaction., If indeed the president and his family took in millions of dollars from government-affiliated entities in China, as it appears they did, we can be certain the details of those transactions are known to Xi and can be used to \"persuade\" Biden to adopt the party line --- the Communist Party line, that is. Rather than hammer China\u2019s president over his financing of  , his lies about the Wuhan virus, or the planned spy base in Cuba, Biden will stick to safe turf, like begging Xi to expand his country\u2019s commitment to climate change. At the least, Biden will most likely avoid challenging Xi on the critical role Beijing plays in poisoning tens of thousands of Americans each year with fentanyl or their support for Iran-backed Hamas., A new AP poll found 58% of adults worry that AI, \"will increase the spread of false and misleading information during next year's elections,\" AP explained.\u00a0  The lost Beatles song \"Now and Then\" features an official music video that blends new video of the remaining members of the band with old clips, at times difficult to tell apart. Famous women, who are already subject to online harassment, will now face countless examples of fan-created deepfakes depicting them in false ways \u2013 first in photos and then in realistic audio and video.   , There was no discussion of China\u2019s repression and human rights abuses against millions of Uyghurs, rampant intellectual property theft, complicity in the fentanyl epidemic that kills tens of thousands of Americans each year, threats toward democratic Taiwan, or economic coercion exerted through its Belt and Road Initiative.\u00a0\u00a0 Time and time again, the Biden administration is more than willing to look the other way for short-term policy concessions at the expense of the American people. Despite occasional stern rhetoric, the Biden administration\u2019s actions toward China are nothing short of appeasement.   recently wrapped up a summit with his Chinese Communist Party (CCP) counterpart in the Coachella Valley to hold private conversations on how the United States and China can partner to combat climate change. \u00a0  In other words, the Biden administration will continue to pursue harmful energy regulations that curb its fossil fuel production and increase prices for everyday Americans while simultaneously allowing China to approve an average of two new coal plants per week., Defenders of a lack of elections have pointed to the British government\u2019s refusal to hold elections during World War II. Others have pointed to the fact that the United Kingdom did not hold elections during its involvement in World War II, and that it would be wrong to hold Ukraine to higher standards.\u00a0  Zelenskyy has argued that in the midst of war, not everyone would be able to cast their votes fairly, that soldiers might not be able to vote and that Ukraine did not have enough money to conduct elections., Pro-Palestine demonstrators disrupted a House Judiciary hearing on addressing the rise of antisemitism and anti-conservative bias on college campuses, chanting \"Free Gaza,\" \"cease-fire now\" and other demands before being escorted out by police. According to many others, including Hamas, it is a call to destroy Israel  \u00a0 Even after being censured by the House of Representatives for her antisemitic remarks and for spreading Hamas propaganda, with   Tlaib doubled down, saying she would not be silenced and that her words were being distorted.\u00a0  But until that happens, until our society utterly rejects the double standards of identity politics, a lot of Jews are going to take a lot of abuse, and silence in the face of that abuse is indeed complicity.\u00a0 , So no matter how bad things are now, rejoice that Hillary will always be the biggest loser and just as Bill said, he did not have sexual relations with that woman, we can be grateful we never had President Hillary screwing over the whole country. 'Gutfeld!' panelists reach to Hillary Clinton comparing former President Donald Trump to Hitler on 'The View.' Sunny Hostin, the only member of \"The View\" not vaccinated for canine distemper, kicked things off by asking Hillary what will happen if Trump is reelected., To pursue the misguided course of isolationism and end support to allies like Israel, Ukraine, and others, would be yet another sign of weakness at a time when forces of evil like China, Russia, and Iran already smell blood.\u00a0    Level with the American people, articulate a clear strategy for forcing Putin to the negotiating table on terms most favorable to Ukraine, and commit to transparent accountability measures so that the American people can trust that their hard-earned tax dollars are not being wasted. That means providing lethal aid to Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan enabled by direct investment in American manufacturing and that will simultaneously result in a more modern U.S. military., Where does that leave U.S. policy as the Hamas-UNRWA propaganda machine provides cover for military assets and educates children to commit genocide while accusing Israel of war crimes?\u00a0 \u00a0resumed\u00a0funding UNRWA after President Trump cut it in 2018. In Gaza, UNRWA subsidizes Hamas by delivering basic services instead of the government \u2013 enabling Hamas to spend more money on terrorism instead.\u00a0 UNRWA staff, contractors and beneficiaries\u00a0are, by design, not subject\u00a0to U.S. counterterrorism vetting \u2013 because to conduct such vetting would reveal the extent to which U.N. money flows into Hamas coffers.\u00a0 , This is sufficient force to conduct a sustained air campaign and to prevent or respond to attacks on Americans\u2014e.g., the 2012 assault on the U.S. compound in  , which left four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador, dead. What is really needed from the U.S. is escalation dominance\u2014bold actions that will terrify the Iranians and scare them off, like when the last president whacked Qasem Soleimani, the head of the IRGC for orchestrating a campaign of attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq. Already, Iranian surrogates have launched dozens of attacks on U.S. military posts in Iraq and Syria\u2014a campaign no doubt orchestrated by the IRGC., For even 22 Democrats to leave statements blaming Israel in America for the 10/07 attacks while calling the Hamas massacre resistance were simply too much. 'Gutfeld!' panelists weigh in on Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., being censured by the House of Representatives for anti-Israel rhetoric. I bet   is so glad she divorced him, but if they build those asylums, they better build them big, because tens of thousands of college kids now believe antisemitism is something you get extra credit for., When student organizations endorsed Hamas\u2019 murderous rampage, when   needed multiple statements in order to make clear that she wasn\u2019t indifferent to this act of terrorism, when Gay told Jewish students at a\u00a0shabbat service that \"Harvard has your back\" only to remain mute when a viral video showed a Jewish student being bullied by pro-Hamas protesters on Harvard\u2019s campus... More than two decades ago, Harvard philosopher Harvey\u00a0Mansfield developed the practice of issuing students two sets of grades: One that reflected an honest assessment of their performance and another designed to mesh with \"Harvard\u2019s inflated grades.\" An\u00a0analysis\u00a0of 160,000 Harvard admissions files found that Asian American applicants outscored every other racial group on metrics like test scores, grades and extracurriculars but were kneecapped by Harvard staff consistently giving them dismal ratings on subjective traits like personality and kindness.\u00a0 , As Cultural Marxism took over, many students\u2014unburdened by the need to work or seek life\u2019s basic necessities like food, water, or shelter, and from the comfort of a taxpayer-subsidized dorm room\u2014have become completely dedicated to cooking up grand Marxist schemes. Unwoke outlines the scope of our problem with the radical left and how its radical ideology is trickling down from universities to boardrooms, the government, Hollywood, and even K-12 schools. Even more people need to stand up and confront this vile rhetoric, defeat the toxic woke ideology indoctrinating students on college campuses, and ensure that our country resembles the one we grew up in., Those who incite violence or endorse terrorist activity by supporting Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and attacks against Jews are in violation of the terms of their visas and should no longer be welcomed as guests of America. The Immigration and Nationality Act prohibits entry of anyone who \"endorses or espouses terrorist activity or persuades others to endorse or espouse terrorist activity or support a terrorist organization.\" That includes people who defend or support Hamas by calling for intifada, jihad, or other similar actions to eliminate the Jewish state of Israel.\u00a0 , While serving as then-President Barack Obama\u2019s secretary of Treasury, Lew championed the Iran nuclear deal and was instrumental in its implementation.   which delivered over $100 billion in sanctions relief to Israel\u2019s greatest enemy, a \"strong deal\" and said that \"it will make our country safer, it will make our allies safer, and it will make the world safer.\"\u00a0   Netanyahu was so opposed to the Iran deal, which Lew championed, that he traveled to the United States and addressed a joint session of Congress to urge congressional opposition. Lew told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Iran \"will continue to be denied access to the [U.S.\u2019s] financial and commercial market.\" \u00a0 , An alphabet soup of Acts \u2014\u00a0The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), The Antiterrorism Act (ATA) and Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0have whittled away foreign sovereign immunity protections in favor of victims of terror attacks and their anguished survivors. Diplomacy \u2014 like easing sanctions, allowing economic growth, releasing prisoners and $6 billion in aid to Iran has gotten us nowhere but to the brink of a second front opening in this new war with another Iran-backed Foreign Terrorist Organization, Hezbollah.\u00a0 Justice for the bereft family members of terror victims is never swift or guaranteed. A constellation of U.S. laws allows the surviving family members of terror victims to sue nations that took part in the acts of terror either directly, or by providing financial backing and other assistance., Kennedy offers something for everybody, which threatens, especially, Joe Biden and to a lesser degree Donald Trump.\u00a0  Kennedy offers something for everybody, which threatens, especially, Joe Biden and to a lesser degree Donald Trump. Instead of trying to bring Saudi Arabia and Israel together, Biden went out of his way to insult the leaders of both those nations and instead courted the vicious mullahs of Iran, who just orchestrated the worst attack on Israel in 50 years., Vietnam refugee Hung Cao joined 'Fox &amp; Friends First' to discuss the possibility of a third-party candidate in the 2024 presidential election and his candidacy to oust Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, D. I learned to swim at the U.S. Embassy swimming pool in Niamey, Niger, in 1976. As a contingency, if we had to evacuate, the 75th Ranger Regiment was to surround Bagram Air Base while we flew everyone out, and they would fold in at the end and exfil.   to the Taliban before anything else, leaving us with no plan B. The additional U.S. Embassy evacuations in Ukraine, Belarus, Sudan, Haiti\u00a0and now Niger show Biden\u2019s failed foreign policy and weakness. While Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is bowing multiple times to greet Xi Xiping, and Secretary of State Tony Blinken is going on talk shows, China, Russia and Iran are collecting valuable diplomatic equity around the world.\u00a0 , House Subcommittee on Weaponization of the Federal Government Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, sounds off on 'Hannity.'  President Joe Biden and several members of his administration have used the power of the federal government to systematically and illegally silence political opposition through a \"far-reaching and widespread censorship campaign,\" according to federal district court judge Terry Doughty, who is presiding over the Missouri vs Biden case brought by the attorneys general from Missouri and Louisiana.\u00a0\u00a0  In his 4th of July decision blocking the Biden administration from continuing to operate as an \"Orwellian \u2018Ministry of Truth,\u2019\" Doughty includes scores of examples \u2013 requiring 82 pages in the factual section alone\u2013to show how the Biden government \"colluded with and/or coerced social-media platforms to suppress disfavored speakers.\" In his 4th of July decision blocking the Biden administration from continuing to operate as an   Doughty includes scores of examples \u2013 requiring 82 pages in the factual section alone\u2013to show how the Biden government \"colluded with and/or coerced social-media platforms to suppress disfavored speakers.\", Rather than hoping for Chinese cooperation on climate change, the United States should strengthen its energy security, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and safeguard its values and interests by outcompeting China in the clean energy arms race.\u00a0\u00a0  Finally, our leaders in Washington must act quickly to pass permitting reform, align our trade and energy policies with Europe, beat China in the contest to commercialize fusion energy and counter the CCP\u2019s influence in Africa and South America.\u00a0\u00a0  The only way to deny China energy superpower status is to win the clean energy arms race at home and abroad., Still, is it a match for the mob, the mob that disrupted subway service and started brawls over the death of a violent, mentally ill homeless man? The subway event had to be staged because there's no way those kids jump onto a live subway track and stay there without knowing the train wouldn't turn them into ground chuck. Greg Gutfeld currently serves as host of\u00a0 \u00a0(weeknights, 11PM-12AM/ET) and co-host of cable news\u2019 highest-rated program  \u00a0(weekdays, 5-6PM/ET).\u00a0, We found a Chinese physician, a scientific researcher who worked for the Chinese government, who was in and around Wuhan when COVID emerged from that lab. So there was a physician who worked on coronaviruses for the Chinese military, who was in Wuhan, telling us in September of 2020 that the Chinese government did this intentionally to wreck the West, to kill people and destroy the economies of its rivals here in the West. Now, these Chinese scientific researchers scolded the Chinese government for the lax safety standards that they said allowed COVID to escape and infect the world., \"It may be time away from a professional role, but it's very much time on\" and actually, it was time on \u2013 time on television, Pete Buttigieg used his time to appear on various shows, including \"The View\" on ABC, where he spoke at length about his favorite subject, which is himself. Weeks after a train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, causing an actual environmental disaster throughout the whole region, Pete Buttigieg as of tonight has still not visited East Palestine. But for much of the time this disaster was unfolding, Joe Biden's secretary of  , that would be Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, was completely disengaged., Kevin McCarthy has taken decisive action as  \u00a0That includes his appointing Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, a conservative bulldog who, as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, is convening hearings on how Big Tech has colluded with the federal government to suppress free speech. Under McCarthy\u2019s speakership, one thing is certain: Congress will be aggressive in the hearings on Big Tech\u2019s collusion with the government and lying under oath about censorship. If Congress acts against Big Tech\u2019s assault on free speech now, its reforms will not only protect open expression, but also data privacy and\u202fchildren's safety., But it happened to the poor benighted town of East Palestine, Ohio, whose people are forgotten And in the view of the people who lead this country, forgettable. So this train derailment was an environmental disaster, not an \"environmental disaster\" like climate change is, but an actual environmental disaster, a disaster that's hurting actual people. That's yet another day that we celebrate race-based federal funding, that, despite the trail train derailment, does not apply to East Palestine because the people who live there are the wrong color., In short, Jexodus wasn\u2019t merely significant to New York: amid otherwise terrible midterm performance, the 2022 Jexodus vote was perhaps the key factor delivering the House to the GOP. \u00a0  In short, Jexodus wasn\u2019t merely significant to New York: amid otherwise terrible midterm performance, the 2022 Jexodus vote was perhaps the key factor delivering the House to the GOP. \u00a0  In the run-up to November\u2019s election,\u202fThe New York Times\u202fran a hit piece smearing private Jewish religious schools \u2014 just in time for New York\u2019s Democrat-run Board of Regents to denounce them and demand control.\u00a0 , Kinzinger's often expressed concern for Syria's men, women and children is what matters and because that concern matters so much, Kinzinger has pushed hard to continue the neocon proxy war in Syria. \u00a0 Results? Kinzinger made that clear the other day when he responded personally to a Twitter account called \"Catturd\" because when you're one of Washington's leading authorities on foreign policy, you spend a lot of time on Twitter reading accounts with names like \"Catturd.\" \u00a0  So, the other day, \"Catturd\" made the mistake of posting a meme that seemed to mock the colors of the Ukrainian flag, colors that are sacred to Adam Kinzinger and every other empathetic soccer mom in her mid-40s., This state visit of the leader of France, our country\u2019s oldest ally, provides the first lady an opportunity to create her own style of entertaining a world leader, just as President Ulysses S. Grant and first lady Julia Grant did when they\u00a0began the tradition of state dinners in 1874 by hosting King David Kalakaua of Hawaii. The grand   tradition of hosting foreign leaders and monarchs resumes Thursday night when President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden host their first state dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte. Here\u2019s a look at how Mrs. Biden\u2019s predecessors handled state dinners over the past six decades: No first lady did more to enhance entertaining at the White House than Jacqueline Kennedy., When the USVSST was established in 2015, two groups of victims were left out: 9/11 victims who had received Victims Compensation Fund payments, and Beirut Marine barracks bombing victims (and a few others who joined their case) who pursued enforcement of their legal judgements against Iran. Thirty-nine years ago,   drove a truck laden with explosives into the U.S. Marine Corps barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, killing 241 U.S. service members \u2014 220 Marines, 18 sailors, and three soldiers \u2014 and severely injuring many others.\u00a0  This bill would rescind and redirect $3 billion in unused CARES Act funds to further compensate 9/11 victims who had been originally excluded from the U.S. Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund (USVSST).\u00a0 , \"When our Marines, sent to Lebanon on a multinational peacekeeping mission with the consent of the United States Congress, were murdered in their sleep, the \u2018blame America first crowd\u2019 didn't blame the terrorists who murdered the Marines, they blamed the United States.\u00a0  \"When Marxist dictators shoot their way to power in Central America, the San Francisco Democrats don't blame the guerrillas and their Soviet allies, they blame United States policies of 100 years ago.\u00a0  \"\u00a0 In the last 38 years, \"blame America first\" has metastasized into \"weaken America first., Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has the opportunity to let the Senate take a historic vote on protecting Congress\u2019 constitutional obligation to be accountable for the men and women we send into harm's way.    This authorization was passed in the months leading up to the invasion of Iraq, giving President George W. Bush authority to use U.S. armed forces to \"defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq. The 1991 and 2002 Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMF) remain on the books \u2013 with the real possibility they will be \"repurposed\" to justify a rush to war or other military action \u2013 and should be debated and voted on by Congress.\u00a0   , Under the Trump administration, the U.S. designated Iranian entities, including the Ministry of Petroleum, National Iranian Oil Company, and National Iranian Tanker Company, because of their longstanding ties to terrorism and applied \"maximum economic pressure\" on Iran. A significant portion of the $30 billion that the Iranian regime was able to capture from evading lawful sanctions supports the Iranian police, including the so-called \"morality police\" unit responsible for the death of Mahsa Amini in September, the Basij paramilitary forces targeting their fellow citizens today, and human rights abusers in the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). Much more, however, is required to slow Iran\u2019s military and terror buildup, enhance U.S. security, support the Iranian people, and relieve the buildup of military pressure against our allies and partners in the region. \u00a0 , Donald Trump was elected president and then a few days later, displaying the independence of spirit that Democrats claim to love in young women but actually despise more than anything, Tulsi Gabbard decided to talk to the new president about an issue that she cared about, which was U.S. policy toward Syria, a country that, again, Gabbard was virtually alone in pointing out has an awful lot of Christians in it, so maybe we should pay attention.\u00a0  When Tulsi Gabbard won the Democratic Party's primary for a congressional seat in Hawaii 10 years ago, she'd effectively won the seat. But Tulsi Gabbard \u2013 as someone who had served in the U.S. military, in fact was still serving in the U.S. military, was an elected member of Congress \u2013 decided, why shouldn't I say what I think?, That\u2019s also why a group of Democrat lawmakers   begging the White House to continue releasing oil from the SPR through year-end \"at a minimum\", in order\u00a0\"to ensure that gasoline and oil prices continue their downward trajectory\u2026\"\u00a0 Unhappily for Democrats (and all Americans) OPEC+ is meeting this week and is reportedly set to cut oil production more than one million barrels per day in order to boost prices. But the Biden White House has made us vulnerable to the whims of foreign (and some unfriendly) producers; that is inexcusable.   undertake an \"all hands on deck\" effort to raise U.S. oil and gas production, which would lower global oil prices and boost our economy. The greeting chosen by Joe Biden to virtue-signal that he would   deign to shake hands with Mohammed bin Salman, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, even as he begged OPEC\u2019s de facto head for more oil?, That chart, as compared to the published final numbers for her pre-COVID, first-year-in-office, looks like this:\u00a0\u00a0 17,684 \u00a0 11,709\u00a0 Meaning: At the current pace, AOC will finish this year with a 51.02% increase in major crime since her first year in office. \u00a0  The   According to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s official government webpage, her 14th congressional district represents more than 650,000 people from the following neighborhoods:\u00a0   Astoria, College Point, Corona,\u202fNorth Corona, East Elmhurst, Elmhurst, Jackson Heights, Sunnyside and Woodside in Queens;\u00a0 Pelham\u202fGardens, City Island, Country\u202fClub, Van Nest, Morris Park, Parkchester, Pelham Bay, Schuylerville, Allerton and Throggs Neck in the Bronx\u00a0 So: by simply correlating those areas to the NYPD\u2019s official precinct webpages, we find that   all or part of the following precincts:\u00a0the 43, 45, and 49 in the Bronx; and the 108, 109, 110, 114, and 115 in Queens. \u00a0  For the seven majors through the year\u2019s 29th week, the chart looks like this:\u00a0\u00a0 9,862 \u00a06,280 \u00a0 So year-to-date, from pre-COVID to now, AOC is up 57.03%.\u00a0 , An economy that runs on renewable and clean energy will improve people\u2019s health and wellbeing; reduce energy costs for consumers; minimize drastic energy price swings; create good paying jobs; and promote national security and global stability.\u00a0\u00a0  Our collective success will require all of us who take climate change seriously to convince the American people, especially skeptics, that passing an aggressive clean energy package is an opportunity to not only tackle climate change, but also address some of the pain points that Americans across the country are feeling right now. A renewable and clean energy economy would help combat inflation and bring more affordable, stable energy to consumers, insulating folks from the volatility we see today in the price of gas, utilities, and everyday goods., Instead of the Biden administration calling on Venezuela, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and other nations that don\u2019t have our best interests in mind to produce more energy, we must instead put faith back in our\u00a0domestic\u00a0energy producers to meet our energy needs. Here are five reasons why the Biden administration should support\u00a0domestic\u00a0drilling: While energy prices are influenced by a broad range of factors\u2014both in and outside of our control\u2014 there\u2019s no doubt that U.S. policy plays a key role in shaping the price that Americans see at the pump.\u00a0    The solution to our troubles lies beneath our feet, and unleashing American oil and natural gas resources through\u00a0domestic\u00a0drilling\u00a0is our only chance to curb inflation and rebuild America\u2019s economic might.\u00a0   , The Biden White House is desperate to rejoin the JCPOA, aka the Iran nuclear agreement that Trump exited in 2018, reportedly offering the most malignant actor in the Middle East tens of billions of dollars in freed-up funds and removal of crippling sanctions in exchange for an unverifiable pause in its effort to build a nuclear weapon. And yet, Biden\u2019s Health and Human Service Secretary Xavier Becerra just extended the national public-health \"emergency\" for another three months, which allows people to receive expanded food stamp benefits and Medicaid, without the usual work or job training requirements. Meanwhile, even though Becerra is telling Americans the health emergency is ongoing, the Biden White House is moving towards lifting Title 42, which allows migrants illegally crossing into the U.S. to be quickly expelled \u2013  .\u00a0, According the Times, internal disagreements on   policy, and particularly whether to keep the Trump administration\u2019s \"remain in Mexico\" approach, have exposed serious fault lines inside the administration between those who worry about the political consequences of the border crisis, and those who want to reject everything the previous administration did on immigration.\u00a0  In the George W. Bush administration, infighting among various factions over America\u2019s Iraq policy led to the single nastiest thing done between rivals in an administration.\u00a0 In the Nixon administration, national security adviser Henry Kissinger sought to keep Secretary of State William Rogers out of the loop on the administration\u2019s outreach to China.\u00a0\u00a0   , At the same time the Russians are relying on the Biden administration to waive sanctions on billions of dollars in Russian contracts for construction in Iran. There are two things profoundly wrong with the Biden administration effort to describe a long war and a protracted conflict. Brave people will die because the Biden administration refuses to provide the tools for victory., Obviously, there's a war underway in Ukraine, and on that basis, Zelenskyy has declared martial law, but we must tell you, there is no evidence that the opposition parties he banned were aiding Russia in its war against Ukraine.\u00a0  On the very same day that Zelenskyy shut down opposition media and all opposition political parties, professional liar and Atlantic Magazine pundit David Frum posted this on Twitter verbatim: \"Ukraine may be the first example in human history of a country that, under the pressure of war, is becoming 'more' tolerant and 'more' liberal. So, maybe you're starting to conclude these people love Zelenskyy, not because he represents the Ukrainian people, but because Zelenskyy is exactly the leader they would like to be with wildly expanded war powers to make everyone who complains shut up at gunpoint., After the Anti-Defamation League and the Louis D Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law issued an open letter calling on university presidents to investigate pro-Palestinian student groups, the American Civil Liberties Union   with its own  , which \u201cunequivocally urges universities to reject calls to investigate, disband, or penalize pro-Palestinian student groups for exercising their free speech rights\u201d. There certainly is objectionable speech out there, but the answer to speech you don\u2019t like must always be to engage more speech, not to employ lies, half-truths, and wilful distortions to shut down someone else\u2019s speech. he Downingtown area school district, the   school district in Pennsylvania, claims to be \u201ca twenty-first century district with the idealistic warmth and charm of a small town\u201d., Throughout most of the \u201cend of history\u201d, financiers thought they had an understanding with central banks: when times got rough, interest rates got slashed. In \u201cthe end of the end of history\u201d rates have shot up and will almost certainly stay high for years to come. \u201cThe end of history\u201d bred in British politics a lazy assumption that tomorrow would always be just like yesterday: there would be no fights in the backyard, the money men would keep coining it in, and prices were for ever heading south., Little wonder Putin calculates that American staying power will again fade as Trump, campaigning when not in court, trashes Biden\u2019s Ukraine policy and his  . Trump\u2019s uncritical, submissive, often suspiciously furtive attitude to Vladimir Putin has undermined Biden\u2019s Russia policy, doing untold, lasting harm. Yet if the Barack Obama-Biden policy of engagement, backed by Britain and the EU, had been maintained by Trump, things might be very different today, inside and outside Iran., In testimony to Congress this week, Blinken   that, with Hamas out of the picture, the right body for that task would be the Palestinian Authority currently in place in the West Bank and dominated by Hamas\u2019s rivals, Fatah \u2013 who remain partitionists rather than maximalists. Yes, some in Hamas  , but past experience suggests if there\u2019s a chance of an agreement that entails any outcome other than the annihilation of Israel, then the maximalists of Hamas will veto it with violence. Right now, that moment \u2013 what diplomats and others refer to as \u201c \u201d \u2013 seems a long way off, though the visit to Israel   of the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, suggests that Washington is already looking at its watch: proof that even some of Israel\u2019s staunchest allies are alarmed by the mounting loss of life in Gaza., Killing innocent Palestinian women and children in Gaza will not bring back to life the innocent Israeli women and children who were killed by Hamas.   Such a strategy must include, as minimum first steps: a clear promise that Palestinians displaced in the fighting will have the absolute right to safely return to their homes; a commitment to broader peace talks to advance a two-state solution in the wake of this war; an abandonment of Israeli efforts to carve up and annex the West Bank; and a commitment to work with the international community to build genuine Palestinian governing capacity. Netanyahu and his extremist partners had worked to marginalize Palestinian voices committed to peace, pursued settlement policies designed to foreclose the possibility of a two-state solution, stymied economic development in Palestinian areas, and passed laws that entrench systemic inequality between the Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel., or Palestinians in Gaza, life is endured moment to moment, not knowing whether there will be food for their children\u2019s next meal, or clean water for an ailing parent, or \u2013 with the death toll now having reached at least 8,796,   \u2013 whether their family will even survive the day. An Israeli thinktank led by former officials published (then deleted) a paper   the \u201cunique and rare opportunity to evacuate the whole Gaza Strip\u201d; a leaked report from an Israeli government research body   the forcible and permanent transfer of all 2.2\u00a0million inhabitants. If the repeated   by western leaders in recent days was partly intended to deflect criticism of their failure to condemn the enormous civilian toll of Israel\u2019s offensive, it also reflects a growing sense that there is no longer a choice., Last week a group of US senators, including Elizabeth Warren, Mazie Hirono, Ed Markey, Tina Smith, Raphael Warnock, Chris Murphy, Chris Van Hollen, Jeff Merkley, Peter Welch and Bernie Sanders,   a joint call for a humanitarian pause, saying that \u201cthe war in Gaza has become a humanitarian crisis and has claimed the lives of innocent Palestinians \u2026 On 16 October,  , led by the representatives Cori Bush and Rashida Tlaib, announced a resolution \u201curging the Biden administration to call for an immediate de-escalation and ceasefire in Israel and occupied Palestine, to send humanitarian aid and assistance to Gaza, and to save as many lives as possible\u201d. To progressives, a humanitarian ceasefire or pause would also afford a moment that we hope can build momentum for further multilateral diplomacy that ultimately brings an end to both Israel\u2019s imprisonment of Palestinian civilians in Gaza and Hamas\u2019s Gaza-based offensive capability., Take Adania Shibli, the celebrated Palestinian author awarded Germany\u2019s 2023 LiBeraturpreis prize for her novel Minor Detail, which told the true story of an Israeli soldier\u2019s rape and murder of a Palestinian Bedouin girl in 1949. Cabinet minister Michelle Donelan defended her higher education (freedom of speech) bill last year   \u201cacademic freedom in these institutions is being undermined in a way that endangers our entire democracy\u201d, adding, \u201cwe find academics self-censoring themselves out of fear\u201d. However, last weekend, in a letter to UK Research and Innovation, she expressed her \u201cdisgust and outrage\u201d at its appointment of two academics to its advisory group on equality, diversity and inclusion, one of whom \u2013 in her own words \u2013 \u201ccondemns violence on both sides but make reference to Israel\u2019s \u2018genocide and apartheid\u2019\u201d., A member of the shadow cabinet who is close to the Labour leader observes that it is \u201ceasy for backbenchers and regional mayors\u201d to make \u201cnot credible\u201d demands for a ceasefire, but Sir Keir would look unserious as a candidate to be prime minister were he to follow suit. Sir Keir Starmer led his party in unequivocal denunciations of the atrocities, combined with unambiguous expressions of support for Israel as it reeled in horror at the single biggest act of antisemitic mass-murder on its soil since the Jewish state came into existence. A rising number of people in his party want Sir Keir to add his voice to the calls for an immediate and full cessation of military action, a demand dismissed by the Israelis as a denial of their right to attempt to \u201croot out\u201d Hamas., In order to maintain the international community\u2019s commitment to a future Palestinian state, there must be a cast-iron guarantee from the Israeli government that Palestinians who were forced to evacuate northern Gaza will be allowed to return when the war is over. Israelis and Palestinians need support from their friends abroad, and our own communities here in the UK that are affected by the conflict need reassurance as the Middle East conflict spreads to the streets of the UK. When this war is over, and casualties are counted, the only choice for the international community is to not only call for, but urgently work for a long-term solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict., For decades, the United States has tried to pass itself off as an \u201chonest broker\u201d between Israel and the Palestinians, while at the same time supplying Israel with both its advanced weaponry and the political cover required during its continued encroachment on Palestinian territory. In the emergency Cairo summit of world leaders assembled to address the violence in Gaza and Israel, the best the British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, could come up with was to call for \u201cdiscipline and professionalism and restraint from the Israeli military\u201d. for South Africa at the Cairo summit, Ramaphosa called on \u201call state actors to desist also from providing weapons to either of the two sides to this conflict\u201d and for \u201ca United Nations-led negotiation process towards resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict\u201d., Representative Nancy Pelosi, our California congresswoman, has   that the United States stands \u201cunwaveringly\u201d by Israel as it conducts its defense \u2013 which is why seven of us   on Friday as more than 200 anti-Zionist Jews rallied, calling for an end to US military aid to Israel. Forced displacement, which Israel has begun, is an established precursor to extermination \u2013 one of the final steps, in fact, in the   cited internationally by genocide scholars and institutions, including by Holocaust museums      . Israeli officials are invoking terrorism to justify their indiscriminate bombing campaign, while the Israeli defense minister said that they are fighting   \u2013 dehumanising language that is always used in the lead-up to genocide., One of the party\u2019s first reactions came from Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, who greeted news of the greatest atrocity in Israeli history by calling it a \u201c \u201d for Republican presidential candidates to criticize Democrats. If the party recognizes the unfolding horror primarily as a \u201cgreat opportunity\u201d to hammer the Democrats, then that opportunity can be maximized by making it as difficult as possible for the Biden administration to respond effectively. Perhaps most disgusting and divisive has been the spectacle of Republicans telling outright lies in order to claim that the Biden administration is directly \u201c \u201d in the attack, as Senator Tim Scott has claimed., Apparently, the freshman senator forgot that the US supreme court\u2019s decision in Dobbs gutting abortion rights cost the Republican party control of the Senate and turned a much-anticipated \u201cred wave\u201d in the House into a trickle, leaving McCarthy to suffer at the hands of Matt Gaetz and his fellow arsonists. Unlike Benny Gantz, Israel\u2019s former defense minister and the head of an opposition party, Netanyahu has not yet been to the White House. In California\u2019s Senate race, Congressman Adam Schiff is   of the three leading Democratic candidates to voice unambiguous support for Israel., In its place is unequivocal support for Israel, even as Israel\u2019s defense minister announces his intention to impose a total siege of Gaza in which no electricity, food or water would get in, and as Israeli warplanes fire US-made missiles that collapse residential buildings and kill entire Palestinian families. Noura Erakat is an associate professor at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, and the author of Justice for Some: Law and the Question of Palestine Since the United States\u2019 announcement of unconditional support and emergency military and other assistance to Israel, Israeli officials declared Palestinians \u201chuman animals\u201d and proclaimed their intention to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity, if not an act of genocide. Israel has subjected Palestinians to settler-colonial removal for 75 years, to the longest occupation in history for 56 years, and to a debilitating siege of Gaza holding 2.2 million Palestinians in an open-air prison for 16 years., When Herzog pledged to overcome Labor\u2019s reputation as \u201cArab lovers\u201d, Ayman Odeh, leader of the largely Palestinian Joint List,   him to stop acting like a \u201ccheap and pale imitation of Netanyahu\u201d and instead \u201cpresent a real and brave alternative to the government of Netanyahu and the right\u201d, based on \u201cequality and democracy and \u2026 a common fight for the future of us all\u201d. Unlike Netanyahu, Herzog has a long history of at least theoretically supporting a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, which would grant citizenship to the millions of Palestinians who now live as stateless subjects under Israeli control. The tragedy of Herzog\u2019s career is that during his time atop the Labor party, prominent Palestinian citizens implored him to stop aping the racist right and instead bring Palestinians and Jews together in a struggle for equality., Yet proposed legislation now  , the  , attempts \u201cto prevent public bodies from being influenced by political or moral disapproval of foreign states when taking certain economic decisions\u201d \u2013 even when the censured conduct is a breach of international law. The bill would allow ministers to rule that particular countries or territories do not come under the legislation \u2013 except in the case of Israel, the occupied Palestinian territories, or the occupied Golan Heights. But legitimate criticism of illegal settlements and an increasingly extreme far right Israeli government must not be silenced, and economic sanctions are a reasonable means of expressing dissent., Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s far-right government is following the playbook written by authoritarians in Hungary, Poland and other self-declared beacons of \u201cilliberalism\u201d: subordinate the judiciary and other independent bodies like public broadcasting to government control, all in the name of \u201cthe people\u201d. But the reasons why outside observers should not hold back are still ultimately similar: doing nothing is not neutral, because it lets down the millions who voted against the current Israeli government \u2013 it won the election by a mere 30,000 votes \u2013 and who hoped that friends of the country would precisely prove their friendship by calling for tough action. Rightwing US and Israeli thinktanks are becoming ever  ; so plenty of   of the constitutional coup stand ready to convince   that proposed changes have parallels in well-functioning democracies: executive involvement in judicial appointments exists in the US as well; the Canadian parliament can   court decisions., He told Professor Kathryn Sikkink, a highly respected human rights scholar affiliated with the Kennedy School, that the reason was my, and Human Rights Watch\u2019s, criticism of Israel. Soon after I announced my departure from Human Rights Watch, the Kennedy School\u2019s Carr Center for Human Rights Policy reached out to me to discuss offering me a fellowship. Some defenders of the Israeli government have claimed that Elmendorf\u2019s rejection of my fellowship was because Human Rights Watch, or I, devote too much attention to Israel., After two years of its hermit-like isolation, 1.4 billion Chinese citizens are now experiencing a nationwide Covid onslaught for the first time with ripples that will not only affect the lives of those in   but the rest of the world linked to the second largest economy. Just as we celebrate those individuals fighting against injustice, we can also find hope in those other warriors for our future \u2013 those in health care, laboratories and research institutions working to find solutions to climate change or disease. He said: Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centres of energy and daring those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance., In the run-up to the election, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed, the UAE\u2019s foreign minister, conveyed his concerns to Netanyahu about Religious Zionism and Ben-Gvir. Most strikingly, the ascendance of the Religious Zionism party and Ben-Gvir will discomfit the Biden White House and test the US-Israel alliance. Netanyahu and Ben-Gvir provide political cover., The British architect Norman Foster (again a Pritzker winner) withdrew from the advisory board of Neom over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, but his practice continues to work on Saudi projects such as the Red Sea airport and an \u201cexperiential marine-life centre\u201d. It is aided and abetted by western consultancies such as the once-hip Californian practice of Morphosis (which is designing The Line) and the London-based Zaha Hadid Architects (at work in Trojena), both of them winners of the biggest prize in architecture, the Pritzker. More recent examples include the decision by the also Pritzker-winning Dutch practice OMA to design the vast headquarters of the Chinese government\u2019s main television station CCTV, completed in 2012; as the writer Ian Buruma asked: would they have done the same favour for Pinochet\u2019s Chile?, Americans, too, should be deeply suspicious of Tehran\u2019s intentions, suggested Iran expert Karim Sadjadpour \u2013 because Khamenei\u2019s grip on power, and that of the illegitimate elite surrounding him, pivots on unceasing confrontation with the Great Satan. Hosting Vladimir Putin in Tehran last month, Khamenei claimed that, just as with Iran, the west and Nato opposed a \u201cstrong, independent Russia\u201d. \u201cThe policies that ... Khamenei has championed for three decades have pushed Iran to the brink of total economic and ecological collapse and, despite staging brutal crackdowns, the country is wallowing in social unrest ...","These numbers, which would make our elected officials green with envy, suggest that even a year after the passing of the beloved Queen Elizabeth II, King Charles is doing his part to guarantee the monarchy remains a key pillar of British life.\u00a0  Having conducted diplomatic tours to France and Germany, the king and queen deployed the charms of skilled non-political heads of state in smoothing over diplomatic grudges with important trading partners while celebrating shared interests and values.\u00a0  While protesters filled London and New York streets calling for annihilation of Israel and death to the Jews, the British Royal Family were quick to condemn the atrocities and meet with Jewish leaders to reassure Britain\u2019s Jews that their safety and well-being is a chief priority for the nation. \u00a0   , A non-Jewish friend sent me a piece about Jewish billionaire Henry Sweica's resignation from the Columbia University board over concerns that the university allowed pro-Hamas protesters to engage in hate speech on campus. Few people I know don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem when Israel uses a 2,000-pound bomb to kill a single Hamas leader that also kills 99 innocents. But it\u2019s Israel that is supposed to figure this all out and apparently the only way to figure it out is to pause or cease or stop pursuing those responsible because they are sacrificing their own people who they\u2019ve never fought to protect., The school, renovated and funded by the PA, stands as a lasting monument to terrorism, sending a clear and harmful message to the young students who attend.  of the PA, is a notorious Holocaust denier, a fact that is well-documented and beyond dispute. The naming of a school in Hebron after Mughir Al-Khdeir, a Hamas operative involved in the kidnapping and murder of an Israeli border policeman, is a glaring example of the PA\u2019s endorsement of violence. By financially rewarding terrorists and their families, the PA is essentially underwriting terror, fueling a cycle of violence that precludes any possibility of peace.\u00a0 , Multiple fights occur on Wednesday night near the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles following the screening of footage depicting the Hamas attack on Israel. This kind of inanity is exactly why Gal Gadot is screening this footage \u2014 footage \u00a0Hamas themselves filmed \u2014 and it\u2019s why terrorist sympathizers are angry with her for doing so. Writing in the National Post, Jesse Kline, who watched the screening in Canada, remarked, \"After witnessing these horrors, it\u2019s hard to disagree with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s characterization of this as a \u2018battle between civilization and barbarism.\u2019, In the embrace of the deterministic view of the world that afforded enormous progress \u2013 think about the state of technology today and the prosperity it made possible \u2013 the world continues to accumulate every imaginable means for reacting. The result: mass demonstrations, in European countries, in Australia, and in New Zealand,   Only a holistic view of the events can help understand the way the world has changed in the woke recent years, and why universities became the stomping grounds for indoctrination.\u00a0  Rep. Ami Bera, D-Calif., joined \u2018Fox News Live\u2019 to discuss the Israel-Hamas war as Biden calls for a humanitarian pause in the conflict.\u00a0 , But, when Jewish students respond to the same question, the figure more than doubles, with 55% of Jewish students stating that they cannot have a vulnerable discussion about Israel on their campuses.\u00a0  Although some students are pushing back against DEI offices that tolerate students advocating murdering others and glorifying  , countless students are scared, remaining silent and despondent, and feeling helpless. The liberal administrative machine and the anti-Israel climate on\u00a0collegiate campuses has made it difficult and dangerous for students to dissent\u00a0against the antisemitic notion that Israel is a colonizing, genocidal force.\u00a0 , Five Harvard faculty also issued a\u00a0statement\u00a0linking the work of \"Palestinian liberation\" to the work of decolonizing Harvard, arguing for \"a more robust commitment to teaching about Palestine, to incorporating work by Palestinians into our syllabi, to inviting Palestinian scholars and community members to speak at university events, and to supporting campus activism for Palestinian liberation.\" The media, the public, and prominent political figures condemned the students for rationalizing atrocities against innocent people, including women, children, and the elderly.  , long accustomed to toeing the radical line, hesitated for days before releasing a\u00a0generic\u00a0statement of condemnation and writing that \"no student group\u2014not even 30 student groups\u2014speaks for Harvard University or its leadership.\" In his program to \"decolonize Harvard,\" Montalvo\u00a0promoted\u00a0materials highlighting Harvard student and faculty activism against Israel\u2019s supposed \"apartheid regime\" and \"settlement enterprise.\", Yet just a few years ago, Erdogan kept Washington busy with one issue after another: from threatening our fellow ally Greece and aggressively challenging French warships in the Mediterranean, to blocking the approval of NATO war plans in Brussels and buying advanced air defense systems \u2013 designed to defeat U.S. aircraft -- from Moscow, just to name a few. As such, Sweden has taken several steps over the past year to address his concerns, from amending its constitution and passing legislation that tightens the country\u2019s anti-terrorism laws, to taking a harder line toward the PKK (and their affiliates) and ending its arms embargo against Ankara. Over the years, this proud Scandinavian country has conducted military exercises with NATO, shared intelligence, developed effective weapons and equipment, and ensured its armed forces (especially its maritime capabilities) are modern and compatible with its future allies., And imagine if the weapons that were left in Afghanistan are traced back against the attacks that happened?\"\u00a0 Massoud\u00a0should know because his father was the Lion of the Panjshir, Ahmad Shah\u00a0Massoud, Leader of the Northern Alliance, who warned the European Parliament in April 2001 of a brewing AQ attack against the U.S. The wholesale abandonment of Afghanistan not only casts serious doubt on the United States\u2019 willingness to honor its promises to its allies, but it has hastened a return of a terrorist\u00a0safe haven\u00a0in Afghanistan that is worse than before. Afghan special operators have been high-priority targets of the Taliban since U.S. military forces withdrew from Afghanistan last year, former Green Beret says., While the people of Iran fight for basic human rights,   with the Islamic Republic of Iran \u2014 the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terror \u2014 to establish a new nuclear deal weaker than the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), giving them the ability to restore their nuclear proliferation program.\u00a0  Biden\u2019s weakened Iran deal would reportedly also release up to $275 billion in frozen reserves to Iran, and it is almost certain Iran would use this funding to perpetuate terrorist activities. This deal with Iran will set into motion a destructive domino effect that is the culmination of the Biden administration\u2019s failed policies with regard to Iran, Russia, the People\u2019s Republic of China and Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.\u00a0 , The government must assume the care and management of Afghan special operations partner forces and other at-risk, high-impact Afghan security officials from veteran groups.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0  Afghan special operators have been high-priority targets of the Taliban since U.S. military forces withdrew from Afghanistan last year, former Green Beret says. To prevent this from happening ever again, our combat veterans and civilians built partnerships with Afghan police, soldiers, nonprofits, Afghan schools, and a myriad of other organizations., James Jeffrey, a former ambassador to Iraq who served under former  as a special representative to Syria, said that former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had given Iraqi politicians a clear choice \u2013 either side with Iran and risk America\u2019s substantial military, economic and political support, or push back against Iranian encroachment.\u00a0    Asked Monday about complaints by Schenker about the administration\u2019s apparent indifference to the political deadlock and growing Iraqi violence, Vedant Patel, the State Department\u2019s principal deputy spokesman, said that the administration has \"consistently reaffirmed the U.S. Government\u2019s commitment to a strong, stable, and prosperous Iraq.\" Former CIA Station Chief Dan Hoffman discusses his thoughts on Biden's Iran nuclear deal and the threat that Iran poses in the region On the eve of a potential nuclear deal with neighboring Iran,  ., Joining NATO brings   into a common air defense picture, extends NATO\u2019s cyber resilience capabilities, and the NATO nuclear deterrence guarantee is included, too.\u00a0    What\u2019s the point of non-alignment when the other camp contains a thug like Putin?\u00a0 Finland, Sweden and NATO have sent a message to Putin: the good guys are adding teammates. Putin\u2019s aggression and the reality of modern war made it urgent for Finland and Sweden to become full members of NATO., It is imperative that we recognize the legitimate national security concerns of Turkey, create buffer zones between the elements that Turkey views as terrorist groups, \u00a0support those who helped us destroy the physical caliphate, and ensure that ISIS does not reemerge. There are oil fields in northeastern Syria that, with more investment, could produce larger quantities of oil \u2013 a benefit to both the world oil market and the economies of northeastern Syria and Turkey. Unfortunately, nothing was done and Turkey moved into northeastern Syria several years ago because of their concerns regarding Kurdish elements launching terrorist acts from northeastern Syria., The Poles have chosen to forget Ukrainian crimes against them, including ancient and new, in particular the genocide and ethnic cleansing of Polish villages by the Ukrainian nationalists during the Second World War. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has produced Europe\u2019s gravest refugee crisis arguably since the Second World War. Others point out that Ukrainian nationalists lay claims to south-eastern Polish territory., But Washington being Washington, commentators have focused on McFarlane\u2019s role in the Iran Contra affair, the scandal du jour of the later years of the Reagan administration, when U.S. officials tried unsuccessfully to reestablish a relationship with Iran.\u00a0    To focus primarily on the scandal misses the role McFarlane played as an unsung hero in Reagan\u2019s ultimate Cold War victory over the Soviet Union. They began by: *Restoring America\u2019s economic health and growth *Rebuilding and modernizing America\u2019s military *Revitalizing the NATO alliance\u00a0 *Halting transfer of American technology to the USSR *Blocking Soviet access to the western capital and banks., President Biden must announce to the world our national interests and strategy to counter global authoritarians starting with the Ukraine war. The perception of Biden\u2019s weakness is palpable in part because his statements and actions are devoid of identifiable national interests when it comes to key foreign policy issues like the justification for our role in the Ukraine war.    He should explain our interests in Ukraine and link them to the shifting global environment which pits the West\u2019s liberal world community against the authoritarians \u2013 China, Russia and an assortment of autocratic regimes scattered across the globe., : On Feb. 4,   and Xi Jinping, announced that China and Russia had signed an\u00a0  \u2013 5,000 words, very detailed \u2013 with each side pledging to the other that they would support mutual efforts to supplant the United States as the world's primary power and make the world safe for the survival of Russian and Chinese tyranny.\u00a0  We have to give priority to China, but this threat to freedom is interrelated the way the dictators of the 1930s \u2013 Mussolini, Tojo and the greatest of the danger, Hitler \u2013 cooperated loosely to undermine the West when the West radiated weakness, when Britain and France brought appeasement to its apotheosis in the 1930s, and when the United States remained complacently isolationist until it was nearly too late. For years, with honorable exceptions, there's been a wide consensus operating on the delusion that Russia is a partner for peace, and China seeks to become part of our system \u2026 This pact should be a warning call that this is not the case and that the free world, and the United States in particular, will have to take seriously the imperative of vigilance across the board, dealing with this threat., \"But no one can do anything,\" says Ivan.\u00a0         Olga, a 35-year-old woman I spoke to, was a month ago only worried about growing her beauty salon in the once-bustling port city and the increasing independence of her 19-year-old son. The targeting of civilians in mass bombing campaigns is designed to force Ukraine's population into submission, to convince residents in larger cities like Kyiv that resistance is futile and will only lead to total devastation and huge death tolls.\u00a0  But while war zones are inherently cruel, few are designed like Mariupol \u2014 aimed to inflict maximum human suffering, to be Putin's funhouse of terror.\u00a0 , Phase I \u2013 Build Combat Power; Phase II \u2013 Condition Setting; Phase III \u2013 Assault the Objective; and Phase IV \u2013 Secure a Destroyed Kyiv. The fighting in the city will be intense, and the loss of life will degrade Russian capability, but the cost in human capital of securing the terrain that was captured will also significantly reduce combat power as the Russian Army assaults Kyiv.\u00a0Failure to secure the terrain exposes the assaulting forces to attacks from their rear.\u00a0 \"\u00a0 Terrain denial by use of persistent chemical agents, use of a non-persistent agent to uproot and expose Ukrainian fighters and their defensive positions, and the use of a\u00a0thermobaric weapon \u2013 aerosol bomb, fuel air explosive (FAE)\u00a0to destroy hardened fighting positions or command-and-control centers in civilian populated areas \u2013 all are violations of International Law., In 2018, President Trump ordered U.S. airstrikes against Assad regime targets after they breached Trump\u2019s own red line on the use of chemical weapons. There are several other actions the U.S. can still take in the near term, such as cutting off Russian-led nuclear negotiations with Iran, allowing for the transfer of fighter jets and surface-to-air weapons to Ukraine, and placing additional pressure on India and China to sever economic ties to Russia.\u00a0\u00a0  Deterrence was restored and the Trump administration sent a clear message around the globe that they would not stand for attacks against our troops or the use of chemical weapons., On Wednesday, 56 of them   a Scottish National party amendment calling for an immediate ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war, and directly defying the party leader, Sir Keir Starmer, who wanted his MPs to abstain and back a policy of humanitarian pauses. If Labour returns to power, divisions of this kind would be likely to affect party management on foreign policy, just as they did in the past over Iraq and Syria. More than a quarter of Labour MPs took part, in spite of a protracted effort by Sir Keir and his aides., We\u2019ve established a WhatsApp group of Jewish students, warning if we encounter protests that risk escalating from calls for Palestinian liberation to those that sound to us like a call for Jewish pain. In the days after 7 October, I walked Oxford\u2019s streets, my home away from home, overwhelmed with grief and despair for victims of Hamas\u2019s premeditated massacre, rape and torture, as well as fear for the hostages held in Gaza and my loved ones. On Instagram, a university Jewish society was  : \u201cWherever you are in the world, we will take you out of your homes and perform a dance of victory and happiness over your bodies\u201d; another was  , accompanied by a video of beheaded babies, reading: \u201cYou must be killed all of u till the last naziest of you\u201d [sic]; a   that said: \u201cYou massacred innocent Muslims, I hope you die too.\u201d, So if you don\u2019t eat pigs, and we don\u2019t eat pigs, why not, not eat pigs together?\u201d And the murder of 1,400 Israeli civilians does not excuse the murderous collective punishment meted out on civilians in Gaza by the Israel Defence Forces. Although I\u2019ve never called myself a Zionist, I recognise how the wretched darkness of the Holocaust and the murder of six million Jews led the world, via the UN, to agree to Israel\u2019s foundation., Like anyone seriously engaging with the past weeks\u2019 events, they know Israel\u2019s government is hardly being subtle: that this weekend, a minister   was instituting a new Nakba, the expulsion of 700,000 Palestinians in 1948; that the defence minister justified a total siege on the grounds Israel was fighting  \u201d. To assuage their own guilty consciences, those who support him are quick to suggest that Starmer\u2019s positioning is irrelevant to what happens, even though Labour\u2019s refusal to push the government in turn helps Rishi Sunak to continue offering Israel carte blanche. The former shadow minister Yasmin Qureshi quoted UN warnings of Gaza becoming a  ; while Naz Shah resigned warning of a humanitarian catastrophe, rightly declaring \u201chistory judges us, and there are moments like this when we have to take a position\u201d., Just as the mothers of the   met every Thursday at 3.30pm, I appeal to the mothers of the world to meet every day at 3pm \u2013 the time of Nawraz\u2019s son\u2019s death \u2013 to mark the suffering of Palestinian mothers and children. No mother should have to pull their dead child\u2019s body from the rubble of the family home because a two-tonne bomb has been dropped on it while she was out shopping. Before leaving the house for essentials, Fadel\u2019s grandfather overheard him explaining to his closest friend, Ahmad, that he had secretly saved enough money to surprise his mother, Neda, with a birthday gift., The Israel Defense Forces say that Hamas has placed command centres under and around al-Shifa and other facilities; Hamas and the hospital staff deny this. But as Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the United Nations secretary-general, warned: \u201cYou cannot use the horrific things Hamas did [on 7 October] as a reason for the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.\u201d he thousands injured by relentless airstrikes need treatment; the health of many more is deteriorating sharply due to the lack of clean water, food and medicines; others have taken shelter in medical facilities in the belief that surely there, at least, they will be safe., While Palestinian journalists have been phenomenally brave and extensive in their coverage, too much of the international mainstream media has insisted on giving credence to Israeli regime officials: for example, when they provided \u201cproof\u201d of a recording of a conversation between Palestinians claiming responsibility for the al-Ahli Arab hospital bombing. This was demonstrated par excellence following the Israeli army expulsion order for 1.1 million people in northern Gaza, when they told the world that they would allow for safe routes for Palestinians to head south. The Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said they were fighting \u201c \u201d and the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, called Palestinians \u201cchildren of darkness\u201d  ., Publicly, that same centre-left politician trumpets Germany\u2019s pro-Israel stance in the media at every opportunity, but simultaneously appears to dog-whistle to the antisemitic far right by framing Germany as powerless but to accept Israel\u2019s demands, even if the result of its bombardment is massive loss of civilian life in Gaza. When I recently published a book about this widespread displacement of Jewish people in Germany by single-minded opportunists, the reaction was indicative: a journalist writing for a German Jewish newspaper put it all down to Israel-hatred and my supposed post-traumatic stress as a woman who had left the ultra-orthodox community. I have also discovered that a transactional relationship defines the public representation of Jews in Germany \u2013 and it obscures the views of an unseen majority of Jewish people who don\u2019t belong to communities financially supported by the German state, and don\u2019t constantly emphasise the singular importance of unconditional loyalty to the state of  ., And then someone from the next block over would shout it to the next block, until it travelled, block to block, window to window, all the way to the nearest civil defence station or ambulance team, who would then race into action. The tanks are patrolling Rashid Street, the coastal road that runs between Gaza City and Wadi Gaza. During the day, the Israeli forces attack the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship hospital, south of Gaza City., Braverman and columnists and commentators such as Sarah Vine at the   and the fascism-downplayer Douglas Murray at the   (\u201cI don\u2019t see why no one should be allowed to love their country because the Germans mucked up twice in a century\u201d) have thrown petrol on to it, deliberately striving to make the desire to honour the war dead of the past incompatible with the desire to prevent further war death in the present. I\u2019ve worn a poppy with pride every year since I was a choirboy, singing around Solihull war memorial on Remembrance Sunday in the suede denim 1970s, where the solemnity of the situation and the stark beauty of the Last Post momentarily softened even the talented young choirmaster\u2019s yearnings. People like the GB News character and doorstep swing-voter-faking liar MP Lee Anderson have changed the poppy\u2019s meaning somehow, making it a badge of allegiance to a whole raft of values I don\u2019t necessarily subscribe to, damning as beneath contempt anyone who, even inadvertently, neglects to wear the red flower., But if selection for a job rests solely on the CV and similar data, it would only be a matter of time before job applicants used AI to create their application and for employers to use AI to analyse and select the \u201cmost appropriate\u201d applicant. The English Folk Dance and Song Society archive lists 15 types of folk dance, from Early Morris to Longsword, Rapper and Molly, many no doubt with their own local variations (\u201c \u201d, News). The world of longevity research is producing important insights, but a bigger challenge remains reversing the decline in life expectancy affecting people in low-income occupations and deprived neighbourhoods., And by using incendiary terms like \u201chate marchers\u201d and \u201cmobs\u201d to mischaracterise whole marches of many thousands of people who are legitimately exercising their democratic right to protest, she implicitly encouraged far-right protesters to come out to counter-demonstrate on Armistice Day. The home secretary, Suella Braverman,   in the run-up to yesterday\u2019s march in London to protest against Israel\u2019s military action in Gaza: to throw caution to the wind, deploy inflammatory language and hint darkly at the worst-case scenarios that might take shape. As prime minister, he is ultimately responsible for his home secretary\u2019s behaviour: her undermining of the operational independence of the police and her stoking of tensions at a highly sensitive time, in a way that appears to coincide with what she believes to be in furtherance of her ambition to one day lead the Conservative party., However, the vast difference in power between Israel and Hamas makes it highly unlikely for Hamas to pose an   threat to Israel. Dating back to Cleon\u2019s speech in Book 3 of Thucydides\u2019 The Peloponnesian War, the paradigm example of demagoguery in the ancient world, would-be genocidaires always justify their actions on the grounds that its targets pose an existential threat to their own people. To justify mass killing by self-protection, by the claim that its targets pose an existential threat, is the  justification for genocide., How many know that far from enabling the creation of a Jewish national home in Palestine, as it had promised in 1917, the British empire  , all but blocking Jewish emigration to Palestine in 1939, at precisely the time it was needed most \u2013 when Jews were desperate to flee Nazi-occupied Europe? It also rests on an assumption that Israeli lives are \u201cwhite lives\u201d \u2013 when in fact about half of all Israeli Jews are not white by any definition, but  , with roots in north Africa and the Arab world, most of them the descendants of refugees pogromed out of their homes in Iraq, Yemen, Morocco or beyond in the aftermath of Israel\u2019s creation in 1948. But how many of those now branding Israel as a settler-colonialist entity \u2013 the better to fit their ideology \u2013 know that by the late 1940s, the push for Israel\u2019s establishment came in   of the British empire, to the extent that plenty of British leftists and anti-imperialists were marching back then not against Zionism but for it?, I call upon state parties to the ICC and non-state parties to help collectively vindicate the Geneva conventions, to help collectively vindicate principles of customary international law and also principles of the Rome statute, to share evidence regarding any allegations or any crimes so that we can properly investigate them and prosecute them as appropriate. In this context, I would also underline that the indiscriminate firing of rockets from Gaza into Israel may represent breaches of international humanitarian law subject to the jurisdiction of the ICC. While Israel is not one of the 123 countries that are   to the Rome statute, I stand ready to work with their national authorities, and with the families of victims in Israel, to complement domestic efforts and ensure that justice is delivered for those affected by these crimes., It is hard to avoid the shocking conclusion that this home secretary \u2013 the minister responsible for policing \u2013 would now probably welcome some scenes of disorder in London this weekend. o home secretary should write   that Suella Braverman published in the Times on Thursday and expect to remain in post. Ms Braverman\u2019s most serious constitutional offence, though, is to subvert the operational independence of the Metropolitan police., She called the rally a \u201c \u201d and accused the Met police of bias against Israel, comparing its approach unfavourably with the tough treatment meted out by police to sectarians in Northern Ireland, football supporters and anti-lockdown campaigners. ow to police a London demonstration should not be a political decision, whether for the prime minister, the home secretary or even an elected mayor. Rowley is appointed by and accountable to the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and to the home secretary, as well as to the Greater London Authority., Sir Mark Rowley, the Met commissioner, has taken the view that Saturday\u2019s march does not pose a threat to public safety. There would be few public demonstrations on any issue if the threshold for a ban were set at breaches of a prime minister\u2019s sense of decorum. Ms Braverman prefers the opposite approach, which is consistent with a pattern of treating any political situation as a platform for the advancement of personal ambition in the Conservative party., Ever since Israel\u2019s forces began the assault on Gaza that has killed  , according to figures released by the Hamas-controlled health authority, each protest for peace has passed off, well, peacefully. These extremists \u2013 who support Israel\u2019s onslaught \u2013  , and they understandably believe they have the tacit support of the government, given their position on the protesters is one and the same. They know that the vast majority of the British public abhorred Hamas\u2019s atrocities, and also must speak out against a humanitarian catastrophe that leaves newborn babies being incinerated by bombs and pregnant women forced to give birth without medicines or anaesthetic., Until last month, Israel had ensured its security by heavy use of military and paramilitary forces, persistent control of populations and high levels of surveillance, together with well-resourced intelligence and security agencies. The war in Gaza is a microcosm of a global reliance on military responses to what are, at root, not military problems but problems that often relate to questions of justice, political representation and economic development. These questions force us to consider longer trends in modern warfare, linked not just to the post-9/11 \u201c \u201d but to a more global security paradigm that is about maintaining control, rather than addressing the underlying causes of revolt., Those numbers, it should be noted, only count the kids who are dying as a direct result of Israel\u2019s indiscriminate bombing. This article was amended on 13 November 2023 to make clearer that a reference to \u201chalf the people\u201d on pro-Palestinian marches being Jewish was in relation to events such as those in the linked articles, not to overall numbers among those marching. They don\u2019t count the kids who are so traumatized from being born in an open-air prison, so scarred from having their neighbourhoods and loved ones eradicated in an apocalyptic act of collective punishment, that their lives have changed for ever., The evening news coyly says scenes are \u201ctoo awful to show\u201d and then that \u201cviewers may find some scenes distressing\u201d, as if to draw us from whatever else we are doing. As with bad news generally, its appeal was said to be an evolutionary response to potential danger \u2013 humans crave a warning. or the first time in my adult life I cannot watch \u2013 or read \u2013 the news., The heavily armed soldier or policeman with his foot on someone\u2019s neck, the checkpoints and segregated streets and neighbourhoods \u2013 these images resonate with the past and present of people who have experienced power behave with impunity, who sense in their own societies a disparity in the value of people\u2019s lives. s the streets fill with ever-increasing numbers of pro-Palestine supporters \u2013 and with a large protest   next weekend \u2013 British politicians and commentators are coming up with new ways of describing what is happening: from \u201chate marches\u201d, in   home secretary Suella Braverman, to empty displays of \u201cvirtue signalling\u201d. It is also an injustice that is endorsed and enabled by western governments, which arm Israel in conflict and refuse to condemn its actions.   is not just directed at Israel, but at domestic governments and politicians who are seen as having a hand not just in the subjugation of stateless Palestinians, but in crafting an entire moral framework for it., While there has rightly been much criticism of leftwing voices celebrating the Hamas attack, far less has been said about the immensely more powerful political figures promoting incendiary, dehumanising rhetoric in the name of defending Israel, and the role of such rhetoric in justifying atrocities in Gaza. It is an attempt to reframe the Gazan conflict as a moral, rather than political, issue, and to delegitimise Palestinian perspectives, an approach that can only make political engagement on a difficult terrain even more intractible. Today, the answer depends on whether we, and political leaders in Israel, Palestine and the west, wish to listen to the Furies or to Athena.  , Overall, enhanced regional cooperation is bringing major investment deals signed during the past year, the first year of my administration, demonstrating growing international confidence in Iraq\u2019s economy. Here in Iraq, we stand in strong solidarity with the Palestinian people, and our country has committed to providing substantial aid, all the while working with our international partners to bring a swift end to this tragedy. We have reaffirmed Iraq\u2019s crucial role in working to protect political and economic security in the region through cooperation with our international partners., So, the question now is whether Labour is capable of effective government \u2013 not just in managing the day-to-day administration, but in responding to potentially world-changing events that require moral judgments and fundamental political choices. If there is to be a pause, I would suggest it should be a very brief pause within the Labour party to assess the moral basis upon which decisions are being taken, and for reflection on whether they align with the moral compass that has directed our party since its foundation. The recitation of ineffective calls for Israel to abide by international law when the indiscriminate effects of its bombing are self-evidents calls into question yet again the moral judgments being made at the centre of the Labour administration., What Putin can do is leverage his relationship with Iran and Syria, and Russia\u2019s contacts with Hamas, to insert Russia into the peace process in the Middle East. Feting Hamas just weeks after its terrorist raid on Israel is part and parcel of Vladimir Putin\u2019s deliberate strategy of bolstering Russia\u2019s waning influence in the Middle East. After the Soviet Union\u2019s allies suffered a crushing defeat in the 1967 Arab\u2013Israeli war, the Soviets broke off diplomatic relations with Israel but increased their support of the Arabs, rebuilding Egyptian and Syrian armies virtually from scratch., That does not mean that Iran will launch itself into an appallingly risky war with the United States at Russia\u2019s behest, nor that Hezbollah will launch such a war against Israel at Iran\u2019s behest \u2013 though it is easy to imagine how the  occurring on the Lebanese-Israeli border could escalate to full-scale war. Witness (in a widely circulated  ) the US national security council spokesperson John Kirby choking back crocodile tears over Russian bombardment of civilians in Ukraine, then justifying Israeli \u201ccollateral damage\u201d in Gaza \u2013 although according to UN  , Israel has already killed almost as many Palestinian civilians in two weeks as Russia has killed Ukrainian civilians in 20 months. Since the invasion of Ukraine has faltered, Russia and Iran have forged a closer  , and Russia has come to increasingly depend on Iran for supplies of drones., While no one in their right mind could justify Hamas\u2019 murder of civilians on 7 October \u2013 and I have not heard a hint of this sentiment in Ireland \u2013 Ireland has a long history of supporting what is viewed as the cause of Palestinian freedom and peace in the region. n recent weeks, leaders from the  , the UK and the US have stood shoulder to shoulder with Benjamin Netanyahu, expressing support for Israel\u2019s \u201cright to defend itself\u201d, a slogan that has wreaked horror on Gaza following Hamas\u2019s horrific attack on Israeli civilians and security forces. As videos of Irish politicians   and criticising the Israeli government continue to go viral on social media, the question asked by those new to Ireland\u2019s position is simple: why?, I now reside in Canada but my family home still stands in that same Khan Yunis camp, metres away from where the bombs fell, and it is where much of my extended family still live. These homes were packed with additional people who had fled from the Israeli bombardment of Gaza City when the bombs started to fall \u2013 one family to each room. Two-year-old Julia Abu Hussein, my sister\u2019s granddaughter, was in the living room of my family home eagerly awaiting the arrival of my niece, Rasha, to take her to the shop to buy sweets., A spokesperson for Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, told the cable network on 11 October that decapitated bodies of babies had been found, and Biden seemed to confirm it at a roundtable event with Israeli leaders: \u201cI never really thought that I would see and have confirmed pictures of terrorists beheading children.\u201d While those dozens of beheadings may not have happened, Hamas undeniably was guilty of horrible crimes against children and babies as well as adults; and, in the other case, it is undeniable that the Israeli bombing campaign has hit many civilian targets and caused many Palestinian deaths. The fact-checking organization tracked the early reports back to a reporter for i24 News, an Israeli news channel, who said she was relaying the eyewitness reports of soldiers., It may even be a first step to stilling the Gaza slaughter, to Hamas releasing the 229 hostages, to no more rocket attacks on Israel, to Hamas releasing the   it keeps shut in Gaza, including 600 Americans and 200 British people. Starmer is not playing politics with this \u2013 unlike Tory backbenchers howling gleeful accusations that if any Labour MP makes a \u201cceasefire\u201d call it will revive Labour antisemitism. Lib Dems likewise use their \u201cceasefire\u201d stance for gain, suddenly appearing in force in Labour seats with significant Muslim communities, according to some Labour MPs., Secondary trauma, also known as vicarious trauma, is a phenomenon where individuals experience symptoms of trauma as a result of witnessing or hearing about traumatic events happening to others, even if they aren\u2019t directly involved. It\u2019s not uncommon to feel helpless and overwhelmed at times like this, but if you find that secondary trauma is seriously affecting your mental health and daily life, consider speaking to a mental health professional. The line between being an informed and empathic global citizen and subjecting oneself to secondary trauma can be quite thin, and many of us find it difficult to turn away from the images flashing on our screens., Then the aid agencies \u2013 UN, NGOs and Red Cross \u2013 can organise the thousands of workers, hundreds of trucks and thousands of tonnes of supplies needed in Gaza day after day, week after week for as far into the future as we can see. If we want to see an effective response from the international community, a good start would be a humanitarian resolution in the UN Security Council \u2013 just as has happened in previous Gaza crises,  . Aid agencies would like to see a ceasefire, but in the absence of one it is common for the combatants to agree arrangements \u2013 often involving the UN \u2013 to protect humanitarian work., But on 7 October, when death squads infiltrated  , massacred 1,400 people in their beds, on the streets and at a music festival; raped women; murdered and mutilated babies and young children; and kidnapped more than 200 people now hostage in Gaza, there are many who once again looked on, many who justified it and a distressing number who even celebrated it. The fact that Hamas murdered babies is irrelevant in this analysis, firmly grounded in the kind of discourse that talks only about \u201cpower\u201d, because the Jews have a state and because Israel is more powerful than the Palestinians. Grimly, it seems that for some, even murdered babies, toddlers or elderly people \u2013 dead Jews all \u2013 do not qualify for powerlessness, and therefore love, if they are Israeli., The demands of security will have meant only a handful of people will have conceived and planned an operation which led to the deaths of more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and plunged the region into one of its deepest crises for many years. But if the apparent power such violence confers may explain the twisted attraction of terrorism for some, it does not explain why have we not found a means to inoculate ourselves against the disease. Because this is not how it seems to those who use terrorism to effect radical change, to disrupt a political process they oppose, force a country to change its policies and attitudes, to propagandise, radicalise and polarise, or simply terrorise., But in London and elsewhere in the UK, there are examples of protest crossing the line into antisemitism and active support for Hamas\u2019s atrocities: individuals   to their jackets after the terrorists who murdered and kidnapped young people at an Israeli dance festival, and carrying pro-Hamas placards. The Community Security Trust (CST), which collates reports of antisemitism in the UK and provides security advice and training for Jewish schools and synagogues, recorded at least   between 7 and 27 October; the highest ever recorded in a 21-day period, and more than those recorded during the first six months of this year. Incidents reported by the CST include a visibly Jewish man being taunted with threats of \u201ckill him\u201d on the London Underground, posters of Jewish men, women and children held hostage by Hamas being defaced or removed in London, Manchester and Leeds, and graffiti featuring swastikas., The Hamas terrorists who killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians, in southern Israel on 7 October claim to be fighting back in northern Gaza after Israel targeted their underground tunnels. Hamas is continuing to fire off rockets and use civilians as shields while trying to lure Israeli forces into lethal urban combat; Israel, meanwhile, has shown scant interest so far in taking up any of these suggestions. Yet how are the Hamas killers to be captured or eliminated without causing the deaths of many more Palestinian civilians, of people who have no control or say over Hamas\u2019s actions and whose lives, too, are precious?, I understand why Palestinians fight for their freedom: Gazans languish in the world\u2019s largest open-air prison; Palestinians in the West Bank face violence from the Israeli state and far-right settlers, and are refused basic rights. A future where Palestinians and Israelis live side-by-side in relative peace is no easy road, but this only starts with the acknowledgement of an unbearable history: That Jews were failed time and again in the 19th and 20th centuries, left with no place to seek shelter from antisemitism. That despite the fact that Britain\u2019s promising of a land to the Jews not theirs to give away  , early Jewish settlers were far from their imperial soldiers, but a persecuted population failed by global governments pre and post Holocaust., Certainly, when student bodies debate whether or not Israel should be erased with annihilating intifada, older civilians may wonder if improvements like trigger warnings, no debate, safe spaces, sensitivity readers, a proper understanding of rolled eyes and other micro-aggressions, and the repeated exhortations to kindness learned from academic communities, always came with an unspoken exclusion where the feelings of Jewish people, of whatever affiliation, are concerned. So it\u2019s not obvious, even given the current horror and the (sporadically) heightened sensitivities characteristic of much academic life, what \u201cparallels\u201d (to quote the Cambridge University   Company, CUOS) between art and life were so obvious as to demand comprehensive community protection. \u201cWhilst it may seem Cambridge is a world away,\u201d wrote the director, cancelling a production of Handel\u2019s , \u201cthere are people who live in our colleges and households who are facing unimaginable difficulties as they watch the situation unfold.\u201d, Israel\u2019s refusal to allow adequate supplies of humanitarian aid and water or any fuel into Gaza, lack of help for the wounded, disputed tragedies like the Al-Ahli   and the widespread belief that Israel is breaking international law are all turning opinion hostile. Iran\u2019s threats to activate its region-wide \u201caxis of resistance\u201d, the advance of allied Iraqi and Syrian Shia militias towards Israel\u2019s borders, attacks launched from Yemen, rising violence in the   and a deepening standoff with   intensify the sense of an Israel under siege on all sides. These four interconnected crises \u2013 the intensifying war, domestic political strife, a losing global PR battle and the intractable hostage dilemma \u2013 are exacerbating a fifth: the long-term strategic, some would say existential crisis confronting Israel., You restore my faith in humanity \u2013 each time you march in our name and call for peace, each time you chant for a free Palestine and a better world, and with every sign, banner and flag that you wave in our support. It is the pictures of hundreds of thousands of people standing up for us and protesting in our name \u2013   in the streets of cities across the world, from Algiers and Istanbul to London and Washington DC. So my message to those people of Britain \u2013 who will stand up for us yet again today by attending peaceful demonstrations held in London and other cities\u2013 is a simple word of thanks., After Hindu-Muslim clashes in Leicester last year, local leaders pointed to inflammatory social media content \u2013 and its algorithmic amplification \u2013 as one of the main causes. In particular, young people in schools and elsewhere must be protected from discrimination and helped to avoid the kinds of polarisation and misinformation that are familiar from other conflicts, but have been supercharged by social media. Two Jewish schools were forced to close in the days after 7 October, and the Community Security Trust recorded   in just over four days., So it is a sad commentary on the polarised times we live in that this week, the UN security council could not even  that provides explicit safeguards for the rights of children currently caught up in the conflict, reinforcing a perception that the international community is as powerless to protect children in Israel and Gaza as it has been in a succession of tragedies in Yemen, Sudan, Myanmar and Ukraine. And with only an estimated   supplies getting through to children in Gaza and   available, a charter protecting the rights of children should urgently ensure that talk of \u201c \u201d or \u201clulls\u201d or \u201cwindows\u201d really means unimpeded humanitarian access to address the current emergencies. Indeed, not much has changed since 1996, when Gra\u00e7a Machel\u2019s report to the UN general assembly on children in conflict spoke of \u201ca space devoid of the most basic human values \u2026 a space in which children are slaughtered\u201d., This week Gilad Erdan, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the UN, furiously accused the organisation of becoming a \u201cstain on humanity\u201d after its secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, declared that while nothing could justify the 7 October massacre perpetrated by Hamas, the attacks \u201c \u201d. But advocates of crushing Hamas in a ground war must equally acknowledge that Palestinians cannot simply carry on living afterwards in hopeless misery, or a new Hamas will eventually emerge to feed off that enduring pain and the cycle will begin again. But so do those who will have felt a strange relief at hearing someone in power articulate what is on one level a statement of the obvious \u2013 that like all terrorist organisations, Hamas feeds off an existing wellspring of pain, even as its own actions only worsen Gaza\u2019s desperate poverty and vulnerability \u2013 and yet has felt unsayable., They included a US-sponsored motion   that, though heavily revised following consultations, called for a humanitarian pause rather than a ceasefire, and a Russian-drafted one that did not mention Israel\u2019s right to self-defence (and which, despite Moscow\u2019s hideous record, piously condemned violence against civilians). The secretary general unequivocally condemned the horrific attacks by Hamas on 7 October, which left at least 1,400 dead in southern  , said that nothing could justify the deliberate harming of civilians and urged the release of the more than 200 hostages reportedly held by Hamas. The Israeli ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, turned on the secretary general so strongly that the criticism, rather than the plight of civilians in Gaza and growing calls for a ceasefire, dominated headlines., By Wednesday evening, Starmer had made his third U-turn (after an ITV interview, where he denied supporting Israel\u2019s right to cut off water and food; then an open letter to councillors stressing how much he felt the plight of Palestinians), to call for a \u201chumanitarian pause\u201d in bombing, which Sunak had already demanded some hours earlier. No matter that war is hardly the right noun for conflict between one of the most militarised states on Earth \u2013 Israel has 10 times more tanks than the British army \u2013 and Gaza, which has no planes, no Iron Dome (all-weather air defence system), barely any money. Last week, council leaders held a virtual meeting with the Labour leadership team, where, I\u2019m told, the greatest discontent came not from the party\u2019s metropolitan elite but  , including many stretches of the \u201cred wall\u201d with large Muslim electorates., There has just been a rare air attack on a suspected Hamas/Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) site in Jenin, but the IDF contribution in the West Bank has been much more of the order of intensive ground patrols. Given the utter determination of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government to destroy Hamas, many thousands more Palestinians will be killed and tens of thousands wounded. These, though, have been resisted and in one incident earlier in the year, one of the IDF\u2019s most modern armoured personnel carriers, designed specifically for use on the West Bank, was attacked and disabled in an attack near Jenin., The world is indeed watching, as Biden said, and it knows, despite Biden\u2019s use of the Holocaust to distort what is clearly in front of our eyes, as more than 800 scholars of international law, conflict studies, and Holocaust and Genocide Studies declared in a   on 15 October: \u201cWe are compelled to sound the alarm about the possibility of the crime of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. More and more Holocaust and genocide studies scholars are refusing to allow the continuation of the dangerous use of the Holocaust to distort the historical reality of the Holocaust and Israeli mass violence against Palestinians. A powerful state, with powerful allies and a powerful army, engaged in a retaliatory attack against stateless Palestinians under Israeli-settler colonial rule, military occupation and siege, is thus portrayed as powerless Jews in a struggle against Nazis., A poll for campaigners Avaaz   this week that 57% of Israelis \u201csupport a plan where Hamas will release the children and families it holds hostage, in exchange for the Israeli government releasing Palestinian children held in Israeli jails\u201d. Hamas\u2019 war crimes against Israeli civilians do not justify Israeli forces committing war crimes against Palestinian civilians. hen 85-year-old Israeli Yocheved Lifshitz was released from Hamas\u2019s underground cells, she was filmed gripping the hand of a hooded fighter who had probably been part of her prison guard while saying \u201c \u201d, the Hebrew word for peace., An online conversation between trauma therapists about supporting those in   rapidly attracted anger that the harms done to Israeli people were not noted in the post, which in turn prompted anger from those who felt the historical harms done to Palestinian people were disregarded by those who acknowledged the sadness and anger Jewish people felt. We usually only turn to psychology during conflict when dealing with the aftermath \u2013 PTSD, depression, anxiety, and addiction \u2013 but psychology can also explain the current dynamics in the world, especially through trauma literature. Israeli, Jewish, Palestinian, Arabic and Muslim people all carry severe historical traumas, and trauma-based reactions are thus magnified., Israel\u2019s deterrence posture must be reinforced \u2013 but Israel cannot deter a Hamas that, according to so many, wanted to incite this very reaction by Israel. Israel rules this state with force and apartheid-like measures \u2013 Gaza is governed by isolation, deprivation and violence, and the West Bank with a creeping annexation that imposes Jewish supremacy and the denial of basic rights to Palestinians. Israel has been willing to live with this status quo because, for Israeli extremists, it fulfills their ideological goal of a Greater Israel and, for the rest of Israeli society, because it does not significantly affect their lives., After all, when Tzipi Hotovely, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the UK,   for Israel\u2019s territory comprising the biblical territory of Judea and Samaria \u2013 that is, the annexation of the West Bank \u2013 she merely echoes Netanyahu\u2019s promoting a map of \u201c \u201d before the UN, which includes both Gaza and the West Bank. So let\u2019s hear from one such lawyer, Israel\u2019s former chief military advocate general and the country\u2019s former attorney general no less,   that to destroy Hamas \u201cthen you have to destroy Gaza, because everything in Gaza, almost every building there, is a stronghold of Hamas\u201d. Last week, the former foreign secretary Jack Straw conceded the Iraq war was \u201c  \u2013 I mean there\u2019s no question about that\u201d, with a casual tone more befitting someone who took the wrong turn off a motorway than someone who played a leading role in a war that killed hundreds of thousands of people., He spent an hour with the Israeli leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, and visited Riyadh and Cairo; he met the emir of Qatar and the leader of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas. This came on top of Sunak\u2019s  , including a hospital ship, and a unit of marines, to \u201csupport efforts to ensure regional stability and prevent further escalation\u201d. Last week, assailed by two  , Rishi Sunak sought consolation on the red carpets of Riyadh, Cairo and Tel Aviv., Maha remembers that I was not in Gaza during the last two wars in 2014 and 2021 and that I have never experienced war as a mother, so she elaborated: \u201cWe left our houses in the dark, ya Samiha. My mother died from a shortage of medical supplies and countless refused applications for Israeli military permits to travel out of Gaza for a scan. My mother-in-law is no longer in her kitchen in Gaza, cooking summakiya., \u201cIsrael\u2019s bombardment and unlawful total blockade of Gaza mean that countless wounded and sick children, among many other civilians, will die for want of medical care,\u201d  . It\u2019s a failure of politics, collective security and international law, following on from the horrific Hamas atrocities of 7 October, which killed 1,400 people in Israel, including many children and infants. The mental health of children under 18, who comprise 47% of Gaza\u2019s 2.3m population (compared to 22% in the US and 33% in Israel), has been in crisis for years., Not only have   been stopped or broken up by police, the Berlin education senator Katharina G\u00fcnther-W\u00fcnsch has also   to schools saying that   \u201cany demonstrative behaviour or expression of opinion  (italics are mine) as approving the attacks against Israel or supporting the terrorist organisations that carry them out, such as Hamas or Hezbollah, represents a threat to school peace in the current situation and is prohibited\u201d. My family comes from Croatia, and as non-Croats we left the country during the nationalist frenzy of the early 1990s, which the late   as the fight for \u201cpure Croatian air\u201d Having been persecuted in Croatia since the early 1940s \u2013 my grandpa managed to leave the   alive at the age of 11 \u2013 we found ourselves in the north of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In addition to banning Hamas-related symbols schools are now free to also ban \u201csymbols, gestures and expressions of opinion that do not yet reach the limit of criminal liability\u201d, which includes the keffiyeh, the Palestinian flag and \u201cfree Palestine\u201d stickers and badges., Like numerous diplomats and politicians in the Arab world, Europe and the US, Guterres is working frantically to prevent the fire lit on 7 October from spreading beyond the besieged Palestinian enclave of Gaza, where Hamas is based, to the wider region. He urged Netanyahu to think through his objectives in Gaza, and what Israel\u2019s postwar strategy would be, before committing his forces to a protracted battle with Hamas. Such a ceasefire, he says, would provide sufficient time to secure the unconditional release of all hostages held in Gaza while allowing unrestricted access for aid supplies., Israel\u2019s war cabinet has set four objectives for \u201cOperation Swords of Iron\u201d: destroying Hamas militarily, eliminating the terrorist threat in Gaza, resolving the hostage crisis, and defending state borders and citizens. In the UN security council, tattered guardian of outraged international law, France and everyone else backed a draft resolution to pause hostilities and overturn Israel\u2019s evacuation order in northern Gaza. Visitors  and Germany\u2019s Olaf Scholz, sandwiching Biden, played to audiences at home and, gentle words of caution aside, otherwise played along with Netanyahu., But Labour risks being consumed by a furore over the position the party leader, Sir Keir Starmer, has taken over events in the Middle East. In Staffordshire\u2019s  , which registered one of the biggest leave votes in the Brexit referendum, the 23.9% swing from Conservative to Labour was the second highest in postwar byelection history. However, Sir Keir junked this approach when he was asked whether Israel was right to lay siege to Gaza \u2013 cutting off power and water \u2013 following Hamas\u2019s massacre of civilians., Yet shit events happen (Harold Macmillan), and in light of the ones we are currently witnessing, we might cringe deeply at Sunak\u2019s apparent recent desire to go all-out for a Victoria Cross in the culture wars and expect to be thanked for his service. onsider the struggle of a modern statesman such as Rishi Sunak, forced to segue from   and state-mandated   to flying to the Middle East and saying something for the ages. Indeed, the strategy might be classified as micro-termist rather than short-termist, given the bag of tricks doesn\u2019t seem to have worked in either Tamworth or Mid-Bedfordshire, both of which byelections the Conservatives  , in seats that would once have been regarded as having unassailable Tory majorities., Even before the Hamas-led 7 October  , warning signs were already blinking red \u2013 a track record of unlawful attacks by   and  ,   and   against Palestinians,   by Israeli officials and   of attacks on civilians by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups. he image of haggard doctors   amid bodies and rubble following   on al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza has sent shock waves around the world, which was still reeling from   Hamas-led attacks and the relentless Israeli bombardment and siege of Gaza. Talking to Israeli partners and friends, almost everyone knows someone either killed when Hamas-led fighters shot civilians en masse, took hostages into Gaza or who   onslaught by barricading themselves for hours as militants hunted civilians in their homes., Egypt\u2019s treatment of Palestinians entering and exiting Gaza is notorious for its indignity \u2013 the latest iteration being Palestinians who tried to enter Gaza only to find the border closed on 7 October,  ; they are being hosted by families who are under strict security instructions not to allow them to leave the neighbourhoods where they reside. After the   (the six-day war, in which Israeli forces captured East Jerusalem and the Palestinian territories, including Gaza), the  , drafted by Israeli politician Yigal Allon, envisioned the Gaza Strip being annexed to Israel. In an  , Israel\u2019s former ambassador to the US, Danny Ayalon, said: \u201cThe people of Gaza should evacuate and go to the vast expanses on the other side of Rafah at the Sinai border in Egypt \u2026 and Egypt will have to accept them.\u201d, It is as if Shibli\u2019s German critics nest in a warm blanket of historical fantasy: they hang on to a vision of Israel\u2019s founding as an immaculate conception, one that has been refuted by any serious \u2013 Israeli or Palestinian \u2013 historian one can consult on the matter. A German, whose family is, like my own German family, implicated in historical atrocities, lecturing an Israeli about what moral or political lesson she may or may not derive from that very history was a grotesque sight to watch. Sign up to  The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion If Adania Shibli\u2019s case tells us one thing, it\u2019s that performative ignorance and avoidance on the issue of Israel-Palestine will not help us to dodge difficult questions about our own family histories for ever., Timo Andres Annie Baker Nico Baumbach Susan Bernofsky Judith Butler Michael Chabon Deborah Eisenberg Madeleine George Masha Gessen Francisco Goldman Andre Gregory Nan Goldin Alena Graedon Amy Herzog Marianne Hirsch Gabriel Kahane Cindy Klein David Klion Lisa Kron Rachel Kushner Tony Kushner Ben Lerner Jonathan Lethem Sam Lipsyte Zachary Lockman Kenneth Lonergan Andrew Marantz Ben Marcus David Naimon Benjamin Nugent Howard Rodman Dana Sachs Ira Sachs Lynne Sachs James Schamus Adam Shatz Wallace Shawn Leo Spitzer V (formerly known as Eve Ensler) Paula Vogel Ayelet Waldman Laura Wexler Hannah Zeavin We believe it is possible and necessary to condemn Hamas\u2019 attack and take a stand against the collective punishment of Gazans that is unfolding and accelerating as we write. As Jews, as Americans, we will be made to feel a sense of safety in our communities, and in the world, not by unequivocal US support for Israel, but by our government\u2019s insistence on the universal human rights that so many of us take for granted., Although Mr Biden spoke about Gaza\u2019s need for food, water and medicine, he said nothing about electricity and fuel, which Israel has also blocked, making hospitals all but impossible to keep open. Mr Biden\u2019s cancelled summit with Palestinian, Jordanian and Egyptian leaders, boycotted by the Arab leaders after the explosion at Gaza\u2019s al-Ahli Arab   this week, would have been an even more important one. The descant to Washington\u2019s support is its clear concern that overreaction by Israel would worsen the already severe suffering in Gaza, where at least 3,500 people have died, and escalate the conflict into a regional war into which others, including the US, risk being dragged., My own parents \u2013 who were visiting from their home, in Dundee \u2013 are trapped in the city of Deir al-Balah along with my brother, a doctor battling to care for injured civilians with dwindling medical supplies. I would really like to hear more from the UK government about the genuine facilitation of peace: not picking a side by saying \u201cI stand with Israel\u201d, which then encourages a carte-blanche approach to war against a people who are already under occupation, under siege. To have this narrative that the current conflict is Muslims against Jews, or Palestinian families against Israeli families, runs completely counter to that., Sunak will be aware that the Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, proclaimed: \u201cWe are fighting human animals\u201d as he ordered a \u201ccomplete siege\u201d of Gaza with \u201cno electricity, no food, no fuel\u201d, adding that Israel intends to \u201celiminate everything\u201d. This time, the UK stands \u201cunequivocally\u201d with Israel as it orders people in Gaza to flee their homes en masse,   as \u201cthe war crime of forcible transfer\u201d, while Francesca Albanese, the UN special raporteur on the Palestinian territories,  . As the horror mounts, Labour leaders issue feeble statements about how \u201cIsrael\u2019s defence must be in line with international law\u201d, when they know full well that it isn\u2019t, and that they helped offer a green light for this criminality., The war crime in this case is the damage to property: article 50 of the first Geneva convention, article 51 of the second Geneva convention and article 147 of the fourth Geneva convention. While the Israeli government could argue that instructing the people of Gaza City to leave is an attempt to protect them from bombardment, this directive might constitute a breach of article 17 of protocol II, forbidding the forced movement of civilians, and of article 49 of the fourth convention on deportations and evacuations. These crimes begin with the use of collective penalties against the people of Gaza (article 33 of the fourth convention and article 4 of protocol II)., When I was 30, my friend Mahir\u2019s father died, and afterward Mahir generously walked my wife and me step by step through the Muslim rituals of mourning and burial; how he attended and washed and shrouded his father, then personally buried him in the earth. I think I am saying that Jewish and Muslim ghosts guided me better during my time of greatest pain than today\u2019s presidents and prime minsters and newspaper owners are guiding us today. When our son died, we had a beautiful template of intimacy to follow, thanks to the love of a Muslim son for his father., That tens of thousands did march for Gaza in London, and protesters gathered across the United Kingdom, the United States and other parts of the western world, sometimes risking arrest, merely to express support for the Palestinians illustrates precisely the kind of courage that is needed right now. Across the western world, our political leadership has decided that freedom of opinion must be curtailed, that expressions of support for Palestinians reflexively equate to support for   and terrorism, and that Palestinian narratives simply must be suppressed. At Brooklyn College, where I teach, the college president forced students protesting for Palestinian rights off campus, where they were met with a phalanx of police officers and a pro-Israel city councilwoman who   brandishing her own weapon., Supported by Palestinian grassroots movements, unions and political parties that represent the absolute majority of Palestinians in historic Palestine and exile, BDS calls for ending international state, corporate and institutional complicity in Israel\u2019s regime of oppression so that the Palestinians can enjoy our UN-stipulated rights. In harmony with international law, the BDS movement has consistently defended the   of the Palestinian people to resist Israel\u2019s military occupation and colonization \u201cby all available means, including armed resistance,\u201d, as mandated by numerous UN resolutions, including   and  , with strict adherence to the prohibition against \u201ctargeting non-combatants\u201d. The fact that the occupied West Bank is under the partial control of the Palestinian Authority, which is implicated in \u201csecurity coordination\u201d with the Israeli occupation, has not saved Palestinians there from an ongoing Nakba of pogroms, extrajudicial killings, dispossession, annexation, illegal settlement construction, daily humiliation and denial of basic rights., The threat in northern Gaza is plenty real as Israeli bombers   neighborhoods in attacks that appear designed less to pinpoint Hamas fighters than to collectively punish the civilian population of Gaza \u2013 the same population that has endured years of Hamas\u2019s military dictatorship and had no say in Hamas\u2019s decision to slaughter Israeli civilians. The order requires 1.1 million people to flee their homes in northern Gaza in advance of an imminent Israeli ground invasion \u2013 the next step in the Israeli response to the horrendous Hamas massacre and abduction of Israeli civilians on 7 October. If the point is to \u201c \u201d, as the Israeli interior minister, Gila Gamliel, says, it hardly takes a brilliant strategist to figure out that, while parts of Hamas will fight Israeli forces in northern Gaza, other parts will deploy in the south., It was only recently that Biden\u2019s frosty attitude to Israel thawed somewhat when he agreed to   \u2013 albeit not in the White House as the latter would have loved, but on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in New York \u2013 and granted Israel membership of his country\u2019s visa waiver programme after a very long wait. Well, Israel is indeed the US\u2019s business, to the extent that Washington provides it with military and other aid to the tune of  , supplying it with the most   and backing it diplomatically in international forums even on occasions when it might disagree with Israel\u2019s policies, or even actions that harm US interests. resident Biden\u2019s   to the murderous attack by Hamas on Israeli towns, villages and kibbutzim that claimed more than 1,200 Israeli lives, the majority of them civilians, was one of the most heartfelt expressions of support for Israel by a US president for a very long time., With a   imminent, many Palestinians have fled their homes in response to Israel\u2019s demand that Palestinians in the north move south of the Wadi Gaza riverbed. Hamas should free the hostages \u2013 or face its leadership being wiped out at terrible human cost, as Israel will probably use more force than is needed to address its threat. Egypt,  , is being offered a debt write-off if it accepts refugees \u2013 risking Cairo being complicit in forcing Palestinians out of Gaza for good., Music is one way to bring people together \u2013 we are all equal human beings who deserve peace, freedom and happiness. Today, our musicians in the West-Eastern Divan and our students in the Barenboim-Said Academy are almost all directly affected by the conflict. We start and end all discussions, no matter how controversial, with the fundamental understanding that we are all equal human beings who deserve peace, freedom and happiness., Following the indictment, key members of Congress have been weighing whether to delay $235m in military aid to Cairo as punishment for Egypt\u2019s alleged involvement in this corruption and for Egypt\u2019s failure to demonstrate consistent progress in releasing detainees and improving its human rights record. If the charges against Senator Menendez are substantiated, it may partly explain why the Egyptian regime seemed so indifferent to America\u2019s previous threats: there were people working to get Egypt assistance without it needing to adhere to human rights commitments. In this context, the Egyptian regime has become proficient in speaking the disingenuous language of western countries, which use human rights issues to exert pressure on dictatorial governments in pursuit of their interests, spanning arms deals, economic issues, and global migration., It cannot be OK that in the past week, a Jewish charity has recorded a 300% rise in   \u2013 a fourfold increase in abuse of one small minority group of British citizens. If we can only sweep our side of the street, then the people we choose as leaders are the street sweepers-in-chief, if you like \u2013 the people we entrust with making our corner of the world a better place. It is in these places, too, where Jewish populations are saying they are feeling more alone and more scared than they did last week \u2013 and in some cases less supported or less understood by people they thought were friends., The   of the review published by Rishi Sunak in March rows back a little by saying that a rules-based system is \u201cno longer sufficient\u201d but that Britain is keen to uphold international law. But the process of gradual but imperfect convergence around the universal rules set out after 1945 that seemed to accelerate in the early part of the post-cold-war era has now, in the era of Trump, Putin and Xi Jinping, gone into reverse. amas\u2019s murder of Jewish civilians in the Kfar Aza kibbutz on 7 October was \u201cwithout doubt a war crime\u201d, the BBC\u2019s Jeremy Bowen concluded in   from southern Israel this week., The EU \u2013 Israel\u2019s biggest trade partner and the Palestinians\u2019 biggest aid donor \u2013 has tried repeatedly to take a hand in Middle East peacemaking since 1980, when leaders of the then nine-nation European Economic Community adopted the   calling for the first time for Palestinian self-determination, and for the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to be associated with peace negotiations with Israel. At a minimum, that would mean taking decisions on foreign policy and sanctions by majority vote instead of requiring unanimity at each stage, and putting a single person \u2013 the \u201cforeign minister\u201d \u2013 in overall charge of foreign policy, humanitarian aid and financial and development assistance, including in the EU\u2019s \u201cneighbourhood\u201d. But she and the European Council president, Charles Michel, have waged a four-year tug-of-war for pre-eminence in foreign policy that has flared into occasional embarrassing public spats, such as in 2021 when the former Belgian prime minister  provided for visiting EU dignitaries by the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, leaving the former German defence minister to sit awkwardly on a nearby sofa., Israel\u2019s defence minister says that it is fighting \u201chuman animals\u201d; a defence spokesman   of emphasising \u201cdamage, not accuracy\u201d; a security official   that Gaza will be a \u201ccity of tents\u201d. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, and the European Union\u2019s foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, have rightly urged Israel to abide by humanitarian law. All the indications are that Mr Netanyahu will  , leading to many more Israeli and Palestinian deaths, and potentially wider escalation \u2013 a particular peril given regional power shifts drawing in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Iran., At Medical Aid for Palestinians, we have released all our pre-positioned stocks of medical supplies to hospitals, as health services have been overwhelmed by the huge influx of injuries. As of Monday, Israel has imposed a   on Gaza \u2013 effectively a siege, restricting the entry of fuel, electricity, and even food and water \u2013 despite its obligations under international law. People fear the worst is yet to come, given the support Israel is receiving from its western allies, without consideration or concern for basic humanitarian principles or international law., Last weekend, such viral posts included Algerian firework celebrations being   on Hamas,   being presented as a Hamas attack, years-old videos from the Syrian conflict cast as   on Tel Aviv airport, and an entirely   holding the Palestinian flag posted by an account that poses as a blue-tick BBC journalist. The channel\u2019s offering was an eclectic mix of neuron-slaughtering dross, to put it kindly, including Topless Darts, the News Bunny \u2013 a giant rabbit who stood behind the newsreader and emoted according to the story being read out \u2013 and Tiffani\u2019s Big City Tips, wherein a model stripped to her underwear while telling you where to invest (in rival telly companies, would seem to be the short answer). Just 11 million people had viewed Musk\u2019s post before he took it down and posted again, this time adopting arguably the worst Musk tone \u2013 fake responsibility., His re-election   will in effect be launched this week, when India, the hosts of the cricket World Cup, take on arch-rivals Pakistan. If the team are crowned one-day world cricket champions this year, Mr Modi may be   to call an early poll to capitalise on the celebratory fervour. The country stunned professional golf when its LIV Golf vehicle said it would   $1bn to merge with the PGA \u2013 despite the latter\u2019s   over Saudi Arabia\u2019s use of torture, imprisoning political activists and history of enforced disappearances., Yet a new report from Human Rights Watch   that the US government has apparently failed to compensate or provide other redress for victims tortured and abused at Abu Ghraib and other US-run prisons in Iraq, and that there is no clear path to pursuing claims. Taleb al-Majli told Human Rights Watch that his detention and torture at Abu Ghraib \u201cdestroyed me and destroyed my family \u2026 They stole our future from us.\u201d In other regards, it reflected what happened across US military detention centres and CIA \u201cblack sites\u201d, as the treatment meted out to \u201cunlawful combatants\u201d held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay migrated to Afghanistan and Iraq., His son Saddam has been   of the disaster response committee; the international community will be coordinating with a man whose forces took \u201csubstantial quantities\u201d of cash and silver belonging to the central bank, according to  , and have carried out a \u201ccatalogue of horrors\u201d, including war crimes,   Amnesty International. The paper\u2019s authors, Dr Renad Mansour, Tim Eaton and Dr Lina Khatib, argue that such deals have reduced direct violence, but overlooked structural forms of violence and have failed to improve, or even worsened, corruption and human development scores. \u201cThose people are not numbers at all \u2026 Those people are love stories, friendships, dreams, ambitions ... are people who had names,\u201d Johr Ali, a journalist from the city,   the Guardian\u2019s Today in Focus podcast., Storm Daniel is a natural disaster,   Elham Saudi, the director of Lawyers for Justice in Libya, but the ensuing catastrophe \u201cis manmade: corruption; lack of infrastructure; impunity; shutting down frontliners in civil society \u2026 Be angry at a system that has enabled this tragedy.\u201d The horror and despair of Libyans is matched by their fury at the rival governments that have split the country and pursued power and profit while ignoring the people\u2019s needs. Key figures in civil society, precisely the people who might mobilise relief efforts, languish in jail while their compatriots need them., It is the apogee of a remodelled Cairo that already rings the city as it expands into compounds, villas and entire new neighbourhoods, linked via new highways, that increasingly house Cairo\u2019s large middle-class population. \u201cThe Egyptian state has always wanted to control histories,\u201d he says, but in more recent times, there has been what appears to be a \u201cdeliberate targeting\u201d in which \u201cthe attempts to erase history are part and parcel of attempts to overwrite people\u2019s claims to property rights over what are clearly historic plots of valuable real estate\u201d. But with that, history, antiquity, green spaces and people\u2019s rights to land and memories are being sacrificed, as the soul of the city itself seems to decamp towards the new buildings on its outskirts., And the Chipkos\u2019 actions to protect the forests on which they depended for their livelihoods  , when hundreds of women in the northern Indian state shielded trees with their bodies to stop them being felled, just as the women of Akbelen are doing today. From student campaigners in major cities to traditional matriarchs in rural societies, women will increasingly be at the heart of the next chapter in the fight against the climate crisis and the protection of the land and the water. The resistance in Akbelen is supported by large segments of Turkish society, but those leading the movement are local villagers, especially village women., After rebel groups angered by the marginalisation of the non-Arab population took up arms, the dictator Omar al-Bashir sought to terrorise the region into compliance by outsourcing ethnic cleansing to the Janjaweed militia.  , known as  , rose through the ranks and then oversaw the regularisation of the fighters into the RSF. hen fighting erupted in Khartoum four months ago, the immediate horror at its impact on civilians was shadowed by a still greater fear \u2013 that the conflict between two warring generals might swiftly spread through the rest of  , causing still more suffering, destabilising neighbours and, in particular, sparking fresh ethnic violence in Darfur. Human rights groups say both the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the paramilitaries battling the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), and allied Arab militias are preying on members of the Masalit minority., It was not only the end of the hope for supporters of the deposed government of the Muslim Brotherhood, and for others still committed to the principle of civilian leadership despite the growing authoritarianism of president Mohamed Morsi, ousted by Gen Sisi. en years ago this week, having recently seized power in a coup, Gen Abdel Fatah al-Sisi commanded police and troops to crack down on mostly unarmed demonstrators in central Cairo. Rishi Sunak gave Gen Sisi the photo opportunity he wanted with a handshake at last year\u2019s Cop27 conference in Egypt, while the activist was close to death due to a hunger strike., David Beckham, another former England captain, spent the last minutes of his career on the pitch in tears, but even by that point he had spent years being more commercial product than footballer \u2013 CEO of Brand Beckham rather than the boy with the magic right foot. Michael Jordan may have immortalised his triumphant \u201clast dance\u201d with the Chicago Bulls in the form of a  , but his first retirement from basketball later involved a tragi-comic attempt to become a baseball player and his final retirement petered out in a Washington Wizards jersey, losing to the Philadelphia 76ers. In Moeen Ali and Stuart Broad, two long-serving cricket warriors going into battle one last time and landing decisive blows to claim the victory, that writer had their ideal protagonists., Nato joy was also tempered by the belated realisation that Erdo\u011fan\u2019s unexpected summit geniality   with Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, with whom he maintains friendly relations for pragmatic reasons of national and personal self-interest. The trigger was the apparent decision by Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Turkey\u2019s president, to   on Nato membership for Sweden which, when last checked, was not being bombarded by Russia. Coinciding with Turkey\u2019s   placed in its custody by Russia and some   between Erdo\u011fan, the EU and Ankara\u2019s old enemy, Greece, all the talk was of a sudden, pro-western tilt by the notoriously unbiddable Turkish leader., So, in summary, here we had a counterfeit Saudi Arabian football shirt, doubtless made at all but zero cost in China or thereabouts, now on sale on a market stall in central Europe. The football strips included plenty of Croatian national team shirts, plus those of clubs with Croatian players: Modri\u0107\u2019s name printed on Real Madrid shirts, Peri\u0161i\u0107\u2019s on Tottenham\u2019s, Kova\u010di\u0107\u2019s at Chelsea and so on. We have to assume that a criminal mastermind somewhere heard the news that Ronaldo had signed for Al Nassr and that the vast amount of money paid would be recouped in shirt sales., \u201cThe outbreak of fighting in Sudan should give world leaders pause: it threatens to be the latest in a wave of devastating wars in  , the Middle East, and South Asia that over the past decade have ushered in a new era of instability and strife,\u201d the independent International Crisis Group warned recently. It damages countries whose path to prosperity, democracy and human rights is uncertain and   Each time Trump sets himself above the law, a dictator in Africa or Asia cheers. While Trump was fulminating about the unfairness of it all and Johnson was whingeing to his mates, hundreds of terrified,   were spilling over the border into Chad \u2013 victims of an unfolding regional catastrophe., This argument may be extended further, to include people from other neglected, post-colonial countries in the Horn of Africa, the Sahel and South Asia, whose sense of hopelessness, impoverishment and chronic insecurity fuels migration. The west\u2019s failure to stop the Syrian regime\u2019s war on its people led to the 2015-16 migrant crisis, when hundreds of thousands of Syrians sought safety in Europe. European countries, including Britain, have persistently failed to develop a humane, coherent and effective approach to the challenges posed by irregular migration., As the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has  , Mr Erdo\u011fan won in elections that were free but not fair; the president controls the vast majority of Turkish media, while political opponents have been harried and, in some cases, jailed. As Mr Erdo\u011fan embarks on a record third decade in power with a conservative and nationalist mandate \u2013 and with increasingly authoritarian powers to enforce it \u2013 millions of other Turkish residents also have good grounds to disbelieve his sunny rhetoric. As the Turkish lira sinks to a new record low following Mr Erdo\u011fan\u2019s re-election, the need to alleviate the deepening economic crisis may create new opportunities for negotiation and rapprochement., The Free Cause party is closely affiliated with Kurdish Hezbollah, a Sunni militant group that originated in the Turkish south-east and gained notoriety in the 1990s when its members tortured and killed hundreds of Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) members and supporters, as well as others who opposed its ideology, though it has since officially renounced violence. Ahead of the runoff elections, the women\u2019s rights group Left Feminist Movement warned that the choice between Erdo\u011fan and K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu was one between \u201cdarkness\u201d and \u201clight\u201d. Last year, bogus charges of \u201cacting against morality\u201d   against We Will Stop Femicide, a feminist platform that fights gender-based violence and keeps a monthly count of murdered women., As it transpired, it was Mr Erdo\u011fan who almost won at the first time of asking, winning over 49% of votes to Mr K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s 45%. For Europe and the US, which had hoped an opposition victory would see Turkey turn more towards the west, five more years of Mr Erdo\u011fan would be a highly unwelcome development \u2013 particularly ahead of a decisive period in Ukraine. Last week, Mr Erdo\u011fan announced a 45% pay hike for public sector workers, the latest in a series of moves including a reduction in electricity prices, and the offer of a month\u2019s free natural gas to households., It stands to reason that the crackdown on human and cultural rights will intensify if Erdo\u011fan remains president at the helm of an alliance that has already forced Turkey\u2019s  , the international contract that aims to protect women against gender-based violence and discrimination, with the argument that such a contract \u201cviolated Turkey\u2019s family values\u201d. While many thought that the opposition\u2019s campaign, centred around  , unity and an end to the toxic polarisation in the country, was a breath of fresh air; others have criticised K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s approach for targeting mostly those who already agreed with his views, for his blue-sky attitude and focus on positive soundbites on social media. The elections mobilised tens of thousands of volunteers who campaigned for K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu and other opposition parties, who rallied to get out the vote, who monitored voting, protected ballot boxes and reported inconsistencies., The president has made his country a major regional player, balancing ties with the west and Russia; the alliance have indicated they would turn towards the west, and Sweden hopes an opposition victory would speed its entry into Nato. But even if Mr K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu wins the presidential race, the coalition must also triumph in the parliamentary contest to carry through its keystone pledge to end the centralisation of power in the presidency and restore parliamentary democracy. His defeat, after 20 years in power, could allow Turkey to move back towards democracy and greater freedom \u2013 the pledge which unites the multiparty opposition Nation\u2019s Alliance., After   as Turkey\u2019s most dominant politician, he can count on a wide range of support thanks to the web of political money that spans the country to feed his supporters, the fear of all things foreign that he inculcates in many Turkish people, and his mastery in exploiting religious sensitivities. The party-state he has built, under the banner of his Justice and Development party (AKP), has not only undermined all the democratic mechanisms in Turkey but also created a model citizen who believes in submission to the regime \u2013 the millions who see themselves in Erdo\u011fan\u2019s image. If the unlikely unity coalition of opposition parties beats the goliath that is President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Turkey will be able to tear off the straitjacket that it has worn for years., The fact that Erdo\u011fan, unusually, is trailing slightly in the polls behind his presidential rival, Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, head of the People\u2019s Republican party and leader of a six-party opposition alliance, is a sign that the political ground may be shifting. Another potentially election-deciding shift came on Friday when the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Democratic party (HDP) \u2013 whose leader, Selahattin Demirta\u015f, was jailed seven years ago on spurious terrorism charges \u2013  . Analysts suggest that Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Justice and Development party and its ultra-nationalist allies may also  , following previous, significant local election defeats in Istanbul and Ankara., Already, more than 450 lives have been lost and thousands have been injured since the clash between Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, head of the Sudanese army, and Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (known as Hemedti), the leader of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, began on 15 April. As Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general,   on Tuesday, the power struggle is not only putting Sudan\u2019s future at risk but also \u201clighting a fuse that could detonate across borders, causing immense suffering for years\u201d. Many more  , too ill to leave, unable to scrape together the cash needed to travel, or too scared to risk leaving shelter \u2013 especially when outbreaks of violence have continued \u2013 for an uncertain future., The fighting between the Sudanese armed forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) \u2013 Sudan\u2019s two main military organisations \u2013 that  , Khartoum, on 15 April is unprecedented even given Sudan\u2019s turbulent and violent history. The UK, in particular, which usually leads on   at the UN security council, has a special responsibility to show strong leadership, including imposing targeted sanctions against all abusive leaders and expanding the existing arms embargo to cover all of Sudan. The security council has long been passive in the face of the former president Omar al-Bashir\u2019s obstruction of justice and the Sudanese authorities\u2019 recent lack of cooperation with the international criminal court\u2019s investigation into crimes in Darfur., Many feared that Sudan\u2019s General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the de facto leader and army chief, and  , the vice-president who controls the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces and is known as Hemedti,  . The current conflict between them was triggered by plans to integrate   RSF \u2013 fostered by Mr Bashir as a counterweight to the army \u2013 into the regular military, under controversial plans supposed to bring about   following 2021\u2019s coup. Hemedti has portrayed himself as a protector of the 2019 revolution and some civilian leaders have, unenthusiastically, seen him as a possible defence against dictatorship under General Burhan., During my stay with her in Canada, Lujain told me of her struggle to find new, meaningful connections in her adopted home country after leaving her friends and family behind in Syria; of the pain of losing those relationships: \u201cI knew I was not going to see them again. While it felt like we were finally able to gain some closure on the lost years, seeing Lujain again has also brought up new questions for me. In February 2023, I flew from the UK to Canada and we were reunited for the first time since the war began., It is true that there have been some tame expressions of concern from Sunak\u2019s government about the current Israeli government, and the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has confirmed that the UK government is   with the Israeli minister of national security,  , a far-right activist within the  . Yet rather than treating the Israeli government accordingly, the UK government has signed a \u201croadmap for UK-Israeli bilateral relations\u201d, committing to various aspects of economic and state partnership. Since the new government was sworn in, as reported by international governments, lawyers and human rights groups, Israel has  \u201d of occupied land and advanced construction in  .   have been killed by Israeli forces (as of 13 March); last year,   Palestinians were killed in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, including nearly 40 children., Some of the lines I wrote in the early days of the invasion crystallise my melancholy: I had always hoped to see the end of Saddam\u2019s dictatorship at the hands of the Iraqi people, not courtesy of a neocolonial project that would dismantle what had remained of the Iraqi state and replace it with a regime based on ethno-sectarian dynamics, plunging the country into violent chaos and civil wars. While there was popular opposition throughout the world (there were coordinated   in February 2003), the war\u2019s architects, merchants and cheerleaders were vociferous and dismissive of those of us who warned against the catastrophic aftermath for Iraqis and the region, labelling anyone who questioned the war a supporter of dictatorship. The \u201cnew Iraq\u201d that the warmongers promised did not bring Starbucks or startups, but car bombs, suicide bombings, al-Qaida and later   \u2013 the latter hatched in the US\u2019s own military prisons in Iraq., From the use of chemical weapons in Syria (where Russia and Iran intervened on the side of the murderous Assad regime) to Yemen, Taiwan and the South China Sea, to Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic weapons programme, a new sense of impunity has coalesced into ever more obvious military alignments between several of these states. Because the invasion of Iraq unquestionably created a space for a bad actor such as Putin to challenge one of the most essential elements of modern international law regarding conflict: that states should not acquire territory by conquest. However you judge the motives of Bush and the then British prime minister, Tony Blair, who led the charge to invade \u2013 foolish, venal, messianic or self-serving \u2013 their tearing up of the rules-based international order to launch an intervention based on misinformation established a precedent that would be exploited by Moscow and others., American power depends on preventing the emergence of a dominant   or a single power in the Gulf controlling the majority of the world\u2019s oil reserves. Washington had little time for French and German diplomatic protests against the illegal nature of the Iraq war. Against the backdrop of the Arab spring, in 2011 Barack Obama sent US forces back into action in Libya, without care for   at the UN security council, on a mission that drifted into an unannounced goal of regime change and a bloody civil war., Iraqis watched as power stations and national treasures were looted, while American troops guarded the oil ministry and Donald Rumsfeld, the defence secretary,   the turmoil: \u201cFreedom\u2019s untidy\u201d. A military adventure conceived by many of its players as a brash reassertion of US supremacy in the wake of the September 11 attacks only weakened and undermined the country \u2013 all the more so after the horrors of Abu Ghraib and wider brutality against civilians. The refugee flows produced by regional instability, along with IS-led or -inspired attacks in Europe, contributed to growing ethno-nationalism and fuelled support for Brexit., Listening to Gordon Corera\u2019s  , a riveting new BBC Radio 4 series featuring interviews with several of the key players, you are reminded that the intelligence chiefs themselves also deserve condemnation for passing on such ropy information \u2013 some of it second- or third-hand, some of it from sources who turned out to be \u201cfabricators\u201d \u2013 for allowing themselves to be badgered into packaging it to suit a political project on a political timetable, and for over-claiming its reliability. The arguments Blair and Bush made for war on Iraq were multiple, but a central tenet of the case for military intervention was that this was for the good of the Iraqi people themselves, who would be freed from the grip of a brutal tyrant. When making the case for war, Blair placed huge emphasis on the intelligence he had seen, which, he said, left it \u201c \u201d that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction., At the forum, the journalist Jane Arraf   the current Iraq prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, what \u201creasons\u201d and grounds for hope he could give to young Iraqis so they would stay in the country. This month, Iraqi politicians and officials met with policymakers, academics, journalists and other representatives from around the world at the 7th Sulaimani Forum, held at the American University of Iraq in Sulaimani. In his answer, he did not address the root causes of suffering; he instead acknowledged his government\u2019s inability to provide young people with jobs in the public sector owing to \u201cfinancial conditions\u201d, and spoke about the \u201c \u201d (entrepreneurship) initiative for development and employment, via the private sector., When the SNP defeated Labour in the Scottish elections of 2007 and that country\u2019s politics underwent a watershed change \u2013 just as Blair stepped down \u2013 it happened partly because the SNP\u2019s then leader, Alex Salmond, had successfully tapped into huge anger about the war, baldly  (as one academic study put it, \u201cvoter problems with Westminster were responsible, with some dissatisfaction with the performance and leadership of the UK government and also with the issue of Iraq\u201d). Next Monday will mark 20 years since the invasion of Iraq: a reminder not just of Blair et al\u2019s responsibility for the greatest political and humanitarian disaster the UK had been involved in since the second world war, but a moment when the supposed political centre ground suddenly lurched somewhere reckless and catastrophic. Then, as the invasion loomed and the UN security council considered its options, Blair said that \u201c \u201d, whereas President Jacques Chirac had said  : that UN weapons inspectors needed to be given more time, and if Iraq did not cooperate, \u201cregrettably, the war would become inevitable., In addition, you chose not to include the following pertinent facts: disruption due to industrial action at Queen Mary has been limited, with less than 2% of our staff taking strike action; and we continue to have very low academic staff turnover, with published figures showing we are consistently lower than the university sector and the Russell Group. , president and principal, Queen Mary University of London, London E1 Last Sunday morning, I read two articles in your Sports section, one telling me how Liverpool were a spent force (\u201c \u201d) and one how Manchester United were younger, highly motivated and better organised (\u201c \u201d). Those of us who care for Israeli democracy stand four-square behind the opposition to Netanyahu both on the streets and in the Knesset. , director, Labour Friends of Israel London WC1 Your article about the failure of most NHS trusts to meet cancer waiting targets was horribly familiar (\u201c \u201d, News). It is also clear that Netanyahu\u2019s self-serving efforts to debilitate the judiciary and the repellent actions of his far-right allies do not command the support of the Israeli people, who have shown the strength of their opposition in demonstrations now entering their 10th week., Whether in Turkey,  , Afghanistan, Iran or war-torn Ukraine \u2026 as we mark International Women\u2019s Day, women and girls and minorities across the world are suffering and struggling disproportionately. Yet instead of helping women and minorities by implementing the Istanbul convention \u2013 the treaty designed to combat violence against women \u2013 the government under Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has done the opposite,   and targeting both feminists and LGBTQ+ activists. The humanitarian organisation Plan International   that, \u201cOur experience shows that children, especially girls, women and the poorest families, are most at risk of exploitation in a disaster like an earthquake., Within hours of the summit\u2019s communique, hundreds of settlers were rampaging through the   with rocks and iron bars, shooting dead one man, leaving hundreds injured and torching cars and properties \u2013 retaliation for the murder of two Israeli settlers by a Palestinian gunman earlier that day. These were the first such high-level negotiations in years, reflecting belated US re-engagement, in the unpromising context of a far-right Israeli government, a moribund Palestinian Authority and surging violence. There were around 100,000 settlers in the West Bank when the Oslo negotiations began in the early 1990s; now there are around half a million \u2013 and several play key roles in this government., hen a   chaired by the former sports minister Tracey Crouch, explored ways to redistribute football income to non-Premier League clubs, the indignant chief executive of Leeds United, Angus Kinnear, denounced the project as akin to  .    The sports minister, Stuart Andrew, has   that the enhanced owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test would not be relevant to the most high-profile ethical dilemma facing English football \u2013 its growing exploitation as a source of soft power by super-rich authoritarian states wishing to clean up their global image. After three decades in which English football\u2019s elite clubs have moved into a different orbit from the rest, and a laissez-faire ownership culture has   the door to unscrupulous buyers, this is overdue., The judges accepted that \u201cas a matter of basic common sense\u201d Begum was groomed in the UK; that it was not plausible that she could have organised her travel to   by herself; that there is credible suspicion she was trafficked for the purposes of sexual exploitation; and that UK institutions are likely to have failed in their duty to protect her. Ministers ask us to reconcile two contradictory positions: that evidence presented by the intelligence agencies to the government shows she is a national security threat, but that there is insufficient evidence to try her on terrorism charges in a British court. Each time one of our allies brings its nationals home, it shows up the UK government\u2019s policy for what it really is: a political posture., Afghanistan is another dreadful example of humanitarian support left to the mercy of a brutal regime after the west abandoned the country to the Taliban, neglecting the needs of the country and its people. The blanket ban on a number of international non-government organisations in Pakistan following the killing of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden is another example of humanitarian assistance falling prey to politics. I am a former war correspondent in   and the week-long essentials of humanitarian practice course in Melbourne helped me explore the history of many of our household names in this sector, how they are coping or failing to cope with the ever-changing dynamics of international politics., In the aftermath of the earthquakes, experts have warned, it is imperative that independent legal committees collect samples of concrete, beams and steel support rods from collapsed buildings, and to demand the buildings\u2019 permits and licensing paperwork from municipalities, as well as proof that subcontractors have adhered to all current building safety standards and regulations. They could not have gone ahead without the government\u2019s many changes to construction and real estate legislation, all meant to facilitate the bloated growth of a destructive and insatiable construction sector. The government argues that these amnesties provide low-income and small-scale homeowners with the legal means to hook up their houses to municipal infrastructure, but critics say that they promote the construction of unsafe and unregulated housing., And for the people affected by this tragedy, the last thing they need to see is their social media feeds clogged with misinformation. Legitimate fundraising operations such as the Disasters Emergency Committee have now raised   \u2013 it\u2019s important that bad actors are prevented from trying to capitalise on the fact that so many people want to help. Misleading content online can prevent those trying to help people getting the right information and support., But even if Mr Assad complies, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the hardline Islamist group that controls much of north-western Syria, is   refusing to accept help from government-controlled areas. But as the United Nations\u2019 top humanitarian relief official, Martin Griffiths,   on Sunday, this is in effect what has been allowed to happen in north-west Syria, which is controlled by groups opposed to President Bashar al-Assad. The United States has   on Mr Assad to halt the weaponisation of aid and channel international assistance equitably to rebel-held areas., Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Turkey\u2019s president, has numerous questions to answer, too, over the speed and effectiveness of his government\u2019s response and over negligent official regulation, planning, enforcement and \u201camnesty\u201d rules that permitted the construction of thousands of substandard apartment and office blocks, schools and hospitals. In government-controlled areas of Syria, too, anguish is mixed with fury at the inadequate response of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s illegitimate regime in Damascus. It can be argued that the democratic west\u2019s failure to bring Assad and his war criminal cronies to justice \u2013 and to force an end to the siege of Idlib \u2013 has indirectly worsened the impact of today\u2019s emergency., Though conflict in Syria has faded from international attention, the complex regional struggle \u2013 not only of the regime against rebels, but of Turkey against Kurdish groups and Israel against Iranian-linked targets \u2013 continues to   in the north and  The mandate for Syria cross-border aid via Turkey has, thankfully, been extended until July. The organisation also urged the international community to pressure Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime \u2013 and Moscow, which supports it \u2013 to hold back on airstrikes. Photos and footage testify to the terrible destruction wreaked on the Turkish side of the border, where the highest death toll is currently recorded., If Erdo\u011fan\u2019s sickening schmoozing of Putin, double-dealing over Ukraine, neo-Ottoman overreaching and on-off aggression towards fellow Nato member Greece are not sufficient proof of bad faith, then consider his other war \u2013 on his country\u2019s democracy. As the most important Turkish elections in a generation move towards a febrile climax in May, and as the western democracies contemplate critical choices in Ukraine, over Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, and in Iran, Syria and Israel-Palestine, these dilemmas boil down to one basic question: is it time to admit that two-faced   is no friend of the west \u2013 and punish him accordingly?   Sign up to  Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion ll of which leads back to the original question: what should the western democracies do about Erdo\u011fan, assuming he wins again?, Given the UAE\u2019s huge investment in oil and gas, it was always likely that there would be serious tensions at Cop28 between action on climate and the fossil-fuel industry. The 2023 climate conference, Cop28, will be held a few weeks before Christmas in the United Arab Emirates, and the fossil-fuel lobby already knows it is getting the best present it could ever wish for. Continuing with the status quo will do nothing less than cement the fossil-fuel takeover of the Cop process and ensure that the industry continues to get away with murder., Denied marriage rights and civil unions and historically subject to homophobia and transphobia, Ukraine\u2019s \u201c \u201d troops have helped to destroy local stereotypes and deliver a crucial lesson in what dangerous misdirection it is to join culture wars about other people\u2019s pronouns when the real enemy is bombing your homeland. Since Russia invaded his country on 24 February, the man   in fetish gear to songs about borscht has cut a definitive profile of courageous leadership, and served as both representative and publicist for the indomitable bravery of Ukraine\u2019s people and communities. Yet throughout November young people gathered across the country with blank pieces of paper \u2013 to denote government censorship of dissent \u2013 and a fearlessness of consequence to fight China\u2019s impractical and unworkable \u201cCovid zero\u201d restrictions., This undocumented tortoise was spotted crossing the land border between   and Greece one early morning in August, shortly after we had emerged from a long queue to have our passports stamped. Reflecting on the origins of private property, the Genevan philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote that the first person who enclosed a plot of land and said \u201cthis is mine\u201d \u2013 and found people \u201csimple\u201d enough to believe this account \u2013 was the true founder of civil society. \u201cIf within a territory of a people there is any deserted or unproductive soil,\u201d Hugo Grotius, the 17th-century Dutch founding father of international law, wrote, \u201cit is a right of foreigners to take possession of such land.\u201d, In 2019, he triumphed in Istanbul\u2019s re-run mayoral contest after Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ruling AKP party refused, Trump-like, to accept his initial victory. But in what looks like more Erdo\u011fan-inspired chicanery, a court is due to rule next month on banning the party for alleged terrorism links. For Erdo\u011fan, politics is personal \u2013 and \u0130mamo\u011flu represents possibly the biggest threat to his re-election hopes in next year\u2019s presidential poll., Our experience teaches us to focus on the strengths of the people and invest in available natural resources, including livestock, agriculture, the blue economy and digitalisation to achieve sustainable development for and with the people. The liberation of people from terrorism, the strong grassroots-led uprising against al-Shabaab and the international partnership helping to facilitate the success of the war on terrorism are the real strengths that must be complemented with stabilisation assistance to ensure these historic gains become permanent. Somalia is threatened by al-Shabaab, the group linked to al-Qaida, who have made it their business to kill, maim and extort the Somali people for the past 15 years., In his 21 September address to the United Nations general assembly, Joe Biden expressed US solidarity with \u201cthe brave citizens and the brave women who right now are demonstrating to secure their basic rights\u201d in a very brief coda to a very long address about Ukraine, Putin, world hunger and \u201cour bold climate agenda\u201d. How else to explain the peculiar locution of President Biden\u2019s shoutout to \u201cthe brave citizens and the brave women\u201d, or the essay, in the 27 September Washington Post, by the Iranian-American journalist Masih Alinejad asking: \u201cWhen will Western feminists help?\u201d A 24 November New York Times article headlined \u201cUnited States Enters New Era of Direct Confrontation With Iran\u201d made it clear that these confrontations will have more to do Iran\u2019s nuclear program than with the current protest., When Iran played England on Monday, the team pointedly  , a gesture of defiance against their country\u2019s rulers and in solidarity with its people, many thousands of whom have spent the last two months engaged in open revolt against what they see as the corrupt, repressive theocracy that has held power in Tehran for 43 years. The people of Iran are showing the world that people everywhere yearn to be governed by those whom they can elect and throw out, rather than by supposed holy men claiming unique authority to interpret holy texts. Any change in Tehran will of course send shockwaves through the region, where Iran has been a key and lethal player in the wars in Syria and Yemen; for years, Tehran has been the threat against which the Gulf states (and Israel) have cohered., I never got to the stage of needing a drink to go to the shops, but I was most definitely at the stage when an evening with a dear friend wouldn\u2019t hold much appeal if there wasn\u2019t going to be drink involved. There should be a special place in fools\u2019 hell for people who spend so much time and money getting to a football match, only to miss their team\u2019s only goal because their bladder is full. On the other hand, there is the delicious possibility of England winning this World Cup roared on by sober fans, whose delight will be diminished not a jot by the absence of alcohol., More than two months after  , a 22-year-old Kurdish woman, died in custody, detained by morality police for supposedly \u201cinappropriate hijab\u201d, a spokesperson for the UN human rights chief, Volker T\u00fcrk,   that this is a \u201ccritical\u201d moment. Even as Monday\u2019s match took place, security forces were firing on protesters in the mainly Kurdish cities of Piranshahr and Javanrud, with a rights group reporting that seven died in the latter alone. But the fundamental contradiction between the priorities and beliefs of the hardliners in charge of the country, and the younger people under their suffocating, corrupt and incompetent rule, becomes more visible and more pronounced with every arrest, every beating and every death., Leaders make grand but vague pledges of action; fossil fuel lobbyists (600 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, this year) schmooze and press governments into maintaining the status quo; and scientists, civil society groups and those most affected by the climate emergency have to scream to be heard at all. This year\u2019s milestone achievement \u2013 the new fund \u2013 is essentially a victory for civil society and collective action among developing countries. Over three decades, the international political system has repeatedly demonstrated its frustrating, heartbreaking and almost bizarre inability to act on a problem that has, at its heart, a simple solution: ending our dependence on fossil fuels., Re gallery directors saying that climate activists attacking art \u201cseverely underestimate\u201d the fragility of works ( ), I think the issue is that governments and the public severely underestimate how fragile the ecosystem is. As the person who cooked in a safe house for those going out on action during the recent   project, I was so grateful to   and   for their always brilliant recipes in Feast magazine. I am writing to beg Joe Lycett to donate his \u00a310,000 to Trussell Trust food banks or any charity or school desperate for funds ( )., The government must now live up to its promise to Mr Abd el-Fattah\u2019s family by applying maximum pressure by all means, including through military and intelligence channels, making it clear that a failure to grant access will cost Egypt dearly in key aspects of the relationship. Mr Sunak raised Mr Abd el-Fattah\u2019s case with the president, but does not appear to have exacted the price for their meeting in advance. It is an outrage that Mr Abd el-Fattah was jailed at all; that he has spent most of the last decade in prison; that he was sentenced to another five years for sharing a social media post about torture; and that he is denied consular visits \u2013 the trigger for his hunger strike., While Mr Sunak declares that he will spend the \u00a311bn   by Mr Johnson to help poorer countries adapt to global heating, he won\u2019t say he will keep to the plan to pay out the cash over five years. Under Mr Johnson there were   dedicated to climate, one chaired by Mr Sharma and one by the prime minister. He did sit down with France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron, and the Italian far-right prime minister,  , to discuss a subject \u2013 \u201cillegal migration\u201d \u2013 that Mr Sunak obviously cares about., The whole world is watching what happens in Sharm el-Sheikh, where I write this from, and he is staking his life on a belief that the world will today stand with him. t 10am on Sunday morning my brother Alaa drank his last sip of water in an Egyptian prison. So far, the UK government has not even been able to gain consular access to Alaa in prison, a basic request., Climate justice, racial justice, economic justice, social justice \u2013 all are interlinked. can\u2019t just be a talking shop, it must deliver climate justice for all \u2013 and standing in solidarity with Alaa and demanding his freedom epitomises this call. And there is no climate justice without racial justice., It would be easy to be churlish about this, given it follows reports that   was planning to go and hog the limelight instead, while doubtless giving the impression of caring so very much more deeply about the planet than his successor (imagine being out-serioused by Johnson, who made   during a rambling keynote address last year to the UN on the climate emergency, and a U-turn becomes easier to understand). The ejection of another toxic populist \u2013 Jair Bolsonaro goes the way of Donald Trump and Australia\u2019s culture warrior Scott Morrison, hopefully quietly \u2013 and the return of Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva despite a corruption scandal some thought had finished him does at least bring some hope for the survival of the Amazon rainforest. Perhaps the best lesson an inexperienced prime minister could draw meanwhile from the   episode is that always prioritising today\u2019s urgent problem (in this case the budget) over tomorrow\u2019s more distant but more existential one (the prospect of the entire planet frying) is roughly how we ended up in this burning mess., In unconventional warfare there is very much a \u201cdirty\u201d nuclear threat, which could be almost as devastating as a battlefield nuclear weapon, by turning nuclear power stations into improvised nuclear weapons \u2013 in essence a massive \u201cdirty\u201d bomb. The \u201cdirty\u201d bomb concept is a complete chimera \u2013 a fantasy designed to terrify people in Ukraine and allow Russia to escalate its unconventional warfare. His ridiculous claim that Ukraine is planning to use a   \u2013 an explosive device containing radioactive material \u2013 implies he is now groping towards more unconventional methods of warfare., The protests set alight by the death of the 22-year-old Kurdish woman have persisted and thrived despite the regime\u2019s brutality, and have gone far beyond women\u2019s rights. EU sanctions imposed on Monday will be limited in effect, but at least have the merit of being targeted at the morality police or leading figures in the regime. The population longs for social and political freedoms, and endures dire economic straits caused by corruption, incompetence and the punitive sanctions imposed by the west but brought on them too by their leaders., Forty-three years ago, the Shah was ousted not just by Khomeini and his clique of radical clerics, but by a broad coalition of opposition groups, which mobilised diverse constituencies: secular urban liberals, old-school communists, new left fedayeen, Islamo-Marxist guerrillas and nationalists who venerated the memory of Mohammed Mosaddegh, the prime minister deposed in 1953 in a coup backed by the US and Britain. in Tehran and other Iranian cities following the death on 16 September of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, arrested by the morality police, who accused her of breaking laws on wearing the hijab introduced by Khomeini\u2019s regime in 1981. Witnesses of the unrest in Iran in 1978 and 1979 included Rzyard Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski, the celebrated Polish journalist, who described one massive march in Tehran as \u201ca human river, broad and boiling, flowing endlessly, rolling through the main street from dawn till dusk., The images are both stirring and moving: a mother, defiantly unveiling beside young daughters; hijab-wearers standing with those consigning their scarves to the flames; women taking to the streets despite facing brutal beatings, teargas and armed police. Yet protesters\u2019 cries of \u201cwomen, life, freedom\u201d go beyond the initial complaint to other concerns about liberty and rights, and a broader sense of injustice \u2013 US sanctions have ravaged the economy and, as everywhere, when poverty hits, women have suffered most. Iran has a long history of ruling on what women can wear: in the 1930s, prohibiting the hijab; after 1979\u2019s revolution, making it mandatory., Western sources  the Turks\u2019 claims, the Bethnal Green girls disappeared into clutches of IS, and British   chided the police for wasting time on these willing \u201cin-house whores\u201d for IS, demanding that the authorities turn their energies back to the safety of \u201c  girls\u201d.   The writer, Richard Kerbaj, notes that al-Rashed told his handler about the girls only after they had crossed the Syrian border, when it was no longer possible to stop them, but claims Canada asked Britain to cover up its role in the operation and that British authorities went along. Canadian media   the story based on Turkish intelligence reports, suggesting that Mohammed al-Rashed was a double-agent acting as an IS people-smuggler, ferrying British nationals into IS territory and relaying their identities back to the Canadians., \u2019m an atheist but I\u2019m pretty sure I just witnessed a miracle, thanks to the Palestinian-American comic Mo Amer. I have written only a handful of articles about being Palestinian; every time I file one I have anxiety attacks for days because of the inevitable character assassinations and online trolling that occur after publication. You can\u2019t even say the P-word without it causing problems: an anchor on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation once had to apologise for using   (instead of \u201cPalestinian territories\u201d), for God\u2019s sake., his was always one\u2019s worst fear for Salman Rushdie: the festival crowd, the vulnerable writer on stage, the buzz of audience anticipation, and then the horrifying irruption of senseless medieval fury. As described in  , Rushdie\u2019s memoir of the fatwa, it became a destabilising experience that took the writer into hiding with a team of special branch officers armed with sub-machine guns. Ever since the Ayatollah Khomeini\u2019s fatwa placed him under sentence of death on Valentine\u2019s day 1989, Rushdie has lived with the dread of violent Islamist retribution., It\u2019s also possible that the attempt on Rushdie\u2019s life may be linked to the US Department of Justice\u2019s extraordinary announcement last week that it was charging a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps with the use of interstate commerce facilities in   John Bolton in 2021. He was also generous in his support for other writers; as an active member of English PEN and former president of PEN America, he knew what it meant to have not only your right to speak and write curtailed, but liberty itself. Ayatollah Khomeini\u2019s death sentence against Rushdie was a turning point for freedom of expression, as Kenan Malik, the most outstanding analyst of this affair,  ., Given the nature and scale of the crimes committed in Ukraine, many more states could, and should, pursue cases that would allow survivors of sexual violence and torture, or those who lost relatives in indiscriminate attacks, or families that spent months in the basements in Mariupol, to obtain justice. Now, Ukrainian survivors of horrendous crimes committed during the Russian invasion have a unique and unprecedented opportunity to pursue justice on multiple fronts. The 2016   for crimes against humanity and war crimes, including torture, sexual slavery and rape, was the culmination of an almost two-decade quest for justice., This week President Biden announced an executive order declaring hostage diplomacy  , calling for sanctions against those taking US citizens hostage, and designating states where it occurs. Behind closed doors we discussed how solving hostage-taking requires a carrot and stick: carrots to get people home, sticks to deter the hostage-takers. The names came from evidence identifying 10 Iranian officials submitted to Truss last September, requesting that they be sanctioned for their role in Iran\u2019s hostage industry., Mr Biden is seeking to bring down energy prices and improve his dismal approval ratings as November\u2019s midterm elections approach \u2013 though the Saudis played down suggestions that they would start pumping more oil, giving him a poor return so far for the image detoxification he provided. Both sense that, despite Mr Biden\u2019s declaration that the US would not \u201cwalk away and leave a vacuum to be filled by China, Russia and India\u201d, the superpower\u2019s interest in the region is waning \u2013 while Mr Putin has   there again. The US has alleged that Iran plans to send Russia hundreds of drones to use in Ukraine, and Gazprom has just signed a development deal with the Iranian state oil company., Instead, this week the G7   pledges to halt fossil fuel investment over fears of winter energy shortages as Moscow squeezes supplies.  against Russia, even as they take a toll on the global economy, will cause ordinary Russians hardship. The havoc that Russia\u2019s war has caused on the world\u2019s energy markets is contributing to an economic crisis that is playing into the hands of Mr Biden\u2019s  . The US is pursuing a three-pronged  : increasing pressure on Russia; getting more oil into markets to bring prices down; and allowing   to raise interest rates to levels that look as if they might cause a recession., I was happy with this choice as I had heard that the UK respects human rights and I believed I had a good chance to save my life here. It is hard to believe that the UK wants to send us to a country that we have no connection with and does not respect human rights. I crossed the Channel in a dinghy organised by the smugglers and when I arrived on 14 May I was taken to a detention centre in Bedfordshire for processing., Now Putin\u2019s brutal imperialism threatens in turn to damage Trump\u2019s arch-foe \u2013 Biden \u2013 by derailing his international and domestic priorities and, if Russia wins, discrediting American global leadership. In two years\u2019 time, Trump or a Trump-endorsed Republican clone could win back the White House. While some of his problems are self-inflicted, Biden\u2019s struggle to repair the global damage wrought by Trump\u2019s four-year rampage has been made infinitely more difficult by  ., Anoosheh Ashoori, who was also detained in Iran \u2013 in his case in 2017 \u2013 and released alongside Nazanin in March has so far turned down his own invitation, calling it opportunistic, and I wondered if Nazanin felt similarly. After graciously thanking him for paying the historic \u00a3400m debt that Britain owed  , Nazanin asked why it had taken six long years to do so, adding that her interrogators had made clear from her second week in prison that this was the price of her freedom. Nazanin also asked the prime minister whether he would provide evidence to the foreign affairs select committee inquiry.","On the eve of what was projected to be a seismic   brokered by the United States, thousands of Hamas terrorists burst out of Gaza and engaged in a vicious rampage of rape, torture and murder against Jews in southern Israel, creating a regional crisis so severe that conventional wisdom now holds that any deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia is impossible. Given Iran\u2019s well-documented intention to eradicate Israel, the regime has good reason to want to disrupt an Israel-Saudi deal that would build on the   and solidify relations between the Jewish state and Iran\u2019s leading regional competitor.\u00a0    Recent Chinese inroads in Middle East diplomacy, notably the\u00a0Iran-Saudi deal on Yemen\u00a0brokered in Beijing last March, could be derailed, all of which gives China, as well as Iran, a vested interest in disrupting such a deal., Iran\u2019s military options are limited, the  , and behind the scenes, a lot of governments in the region want to contain Iran. Iran\u2019s President Ibrahim Raisi complained China does not do enough for Iran during a Beijing visit earlier this year.\u00a0   China buys 58% of Iran\u2019s oil, skirting sanctions and keeping Iran in business., While he predicted that Hamas would win its \"blessed battle\" with Israel and praised the rocket attacks on Israel and U.S. bases in the region by other Iranian-affiliated militant groups in Iraq and Yemen, Nasrallah did not say that Hezbollah and the Iranian-led \"axis of resistance\" would immediately do more to help Hamas. Both calculations might still prove valid if Palestinian deaths and suffering in Gaza continue to command the world\u2019s attention and spark increasing outrage, but Hamas\u2019s hope that Iran and Hezbollah, which has de facto control of Lebanon, would escalate the conflict to defend Hamas and the Palestinians of Gaza seems to be misplaced. If Hamas was distressed by Hezbollah\u2019s apparent reluctance to offer greater military aid, it must also have been disappointed by Washington\u2019s continuing support for Israel\u2019s right to bomb Hamas strongholds despite soaring Palestinian civilian deaths and a looming humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza., Aissami is known to have longstanding contacts to Mideast nations and is believed by U.S. law enforcement to have provided false passports to Hamas and Hezbollah elements.\u00a0\u00a0  Beginning in 2005, Iran\u00a0began an initiative to increase\u00a0its presence in Latin America, opening six new embassies and putting the puppet-master of the current Gaza war at America\u2019s doorstep.\u00a0\u00a0  The focus on these groups has been a luxury belief of Washington elites made possible only by the cessation of the threat of Islamist extremism, due to the tireless work of previous intelligence and law enforcement officials. \u00a0 , Will President Joe Biden and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman be holding their noses when they meet during Biden\u2019s first trip as president to Saudi Arabia on Friday? For MBS, argues veteran Saudi expert Gregory Gause, Biden\u2019s visit will bestow the political rehabilitation he craves.   of the dramatic social and economic changes he has made as part of his Vision 2030 \u2014 letting women drive, ending their segregation in public, containing the odious religious police, allowing music concerts and cinemas, and ending at least official support for radical Islamist preachers and schools at home and abroad.\u00a0  While the Saudis might announce greater open public cooperation with Israel \u2013 say, expanding overflight rights or allowing direct flights for religious pilgrims \u2013 King Salman, the ailing, 86-year-old ruler, is unlikely to establish formal ties with Israel now as several other Arab states have done under the 2020 Abraham Accords, Trump\u2019s most notable Middle East achievement., \"\u00a0 If we re-enter the JCPOA or some variation of it, undoubtedly there will come a time when American, Middle Eastern and European children ask a similar and horrifying question, wondering, incredulously, how we did not save the Middle East, and many countries well beyond, when we had all the signs clearly laid out that appeasement of the Iranian regime will lead to a disaster of epic proportions.\u00a0  The Iranian regime is watching as it sees the enormous leverage Russia has from the threat of nuclear weapons which could be used against any country standing in Russia\u2019s way. The Iranian regime is watching as it sees the enormous leverage Russia has from the threat of nuclear weapons which could be used against any country standing in Russia\u2019s way., In the quest for normalised relations with Arab states, Israel\u2019s leaders treated the Palestinians as a defeated people and ignored the cautions of a bevy of analysts of a ferocious explosion if Israel persisted with its occupation of the land and lives of another people. It is not clear that the mass killings and kidnappings of Israelis, the consequent slaughter of Palestinians and the reduction of   to rubble had a higher purpose \u2013 with the possible exceptions of forestalling closer Saudi-Israel relations and the elevation of Hamas over the Palestinian Authority. A few weeks before Israel was caught off guard by the Egyptian-Syrian military offensive in 1973, the Israeli prime minister, Golda Meir, told me that if the Arabs were to start a war, she would \u201cfeel sorry for the Arabs\u201d., Fourth, slowly weakening Hamas, as opposed to pounding it relentlessly and killing many more Palestinian civilians as a result, might reduce the chances of another front by Iran and Hezbollah opening up against the IDF in Lebanon or Syria. In lieu of a massive ground incursion, the IDF will seek to encircle and bleed Hamas until the threat it poses to Israeli population centres becomes negligible or manageable. For those who have been critical of Washington and its strong support of Israel in its military response, know that without Biden\u2019s political pressure, Israel might have gone all-in against Hamas., This way Iran does not undermine Hamas\u2019s stature, but at the same time the invocation of Hezbollah places it as a stand-in for all Iran-backed militias in the Middle East \u2013 Hamas included \u2013 and therefore affirms Iran\u2019s position as their patron. ince 7 October, questions have been posed over whether Hezbollah would intervene in the fight against Israel in aid of Hamas, and on the extent of Iran\u2019s involvement in Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel. With Hezbollah being the better equipped of the two militant groups, there is a clear imperative for Hezbollah to let Hamas be the leading actor in this war so as not to detract from Hamas\u2019s pursuit of status., The US, Israel\u2019s point of leverage in the region, is no longer as influential as it was \u2013 a combination of a sclerotic Middle East policy, high energy prices dropping a confidence-boosting windfall to oil- and gas-producing countries, and decreased distracting tensions within and between Arab countries themselves, diminishing the need for the US\u2019s security profile in the region. Bombing Gaza, cutting it off and lashing out, has drawn not just the ire of the \u201cArab street\u201d, too easily disregarded as a place of regular futile flag-burning anger, but also global human rights   in New York and London, which now accuse Israel of  . The protests are increasingly an immersive cathartic state of mourning for all the losses that many have to reconcile themselves with; the weakness and lack of solidarity and compact between a large bloc of countries that have chosen to pursue self-interest rather than pan-Arabism, the dearth of democracy in the region, and the lack of dignity and human rights that comes with it., The Biden administration has been so committed to its normalization strategy \u2013 and the deliberate ignorance of Palestinian conditions \u2013 that it   for a Saudi-Israel deal even after the 7 October Hamas attacks and Israeli assault on Gaza. oe Biden flew to Israel on Wednesday to prove how deeply he and the US political establishment support Israel, even as it intensifies its indiscriminate bombing of Gaza, demands the forced displacement of more than 1 million Palestinians, and prepares for a ground invasion of the territory. To prove that he is a great friend to Israel ahead of his re-election campaign in 2024, Biden is risking a wider war in the region \u2013 one that could draw in Hezbollah, whose fighters are already skirmishing with Israeli troops along Lebanon\u2019s southern border; Palestinians in the West Bank; and possibly even Iran, which supports Hamas and Hezbollah., We do not know for sure   the al-Ahli Arab hospital, but the loss of at least 500 lives is either evidence that a heinous war crime has been committed through deliberate targeting of civilian infrastructure, or it is proof that in a place as densely populated as Gaza it is utterly impossible to minimise loss of civilian life. The UN estimates that people in Gaza now have access to an average of just 3 litres of water a day when a person needs 50-100 for basic health needs. According to the UN, at least six of Gaza\u2019s water wells, three water pumping stations and one water reservoir have been damaged so far., But Hezbollah has indicated that it has  : the forcible displacement of large numbers of Palestinians outside Gaza \u2013 though Egypt has made it clear it does not want them \u2013 and a ground invasion aiming to destroy Hamas: Israel\u2019s stated intention. The US hopes two aircraft carrier groups in the eastern Mediterranean, non-stop shuttle diplomacy by the secretary of state and a presidential visit to Israel will see off the twin spectres of even greater humanitarian disaster in Gaza and regional catastrophe. Behind Hezbollah stands Iran; its foreign minister has   of \u201cmultiple fronts\u201d opening against Israel if it continues to kill civilians in Gaza., Iran is the \u201cstate actor\u201d that controls and coordinates the \u201cnon-state actors\u201d \u2013 Hamas and the militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza; Tehran-affiliated militias in Syria, Iraq and Yemen; and the most powerful of them all, Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah (the \u201cParty of God\u201d). Khamenei and Ebrahim Raisi, Iran\u2019s hardline president, sense weakness as they watch an Israel   by Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s anti-democratic, hard-right policies. he foremost concern of western governments as the Israel-Hamas war enters a murderous second week is not the plight of Palestinians in Gaza., Necessary, too, is concerted international diplomatic pressure on Iran, on Hamas\u2019s political leaders in Doha to halt rocket and other attacks, and on their Qatari hosts to explain why they continue to allow the group to freely operate there. Protracted, street-by-street urban warfare against entrenched Hamas positions, booby traps and ambushes is a nightmare Israel\u2019s army has previously sought to avoid, principally because it is unlikely to succeed. The terrorist attacks by young Palestinians directed by Hamas in Gaza and trained and armed by Iran were an abomination for which there is no possible excuse., Underlying all this is another basic failure \u2013 the collective moral failure of the \u201cinternational community\u201d to enforce the laws of war, prevent collective punishments, respect the lives of civilians in conflict zones and abide by the UN charter and human rights treaties. . Yet even now this discredited leader is mobilising Israel\u2019s young people by the hundreds of thousands to fight a war his myopic misjudgments did so much to bring about. Now, once again, in  , the aggressive blundering of angry old men rains curses on the young, twisting minds, blighting lives, imperilling futures., In Gaza, the Israeli military is reportedly   after such warnings \u2013 attacks that not only endanger any civilians who remain but also seem more designed to punish the civilian population than to target Hamas fighters who impose their will on the people of Gaza by force. The declared siege of Gaza, blocking food, water and electricity, violates the   to allow humanitarian aid to civilians in need, as the people of Gaza certainly are as they suffer massive Israeli bombardment. Yes, Palestinians were understandably frustrated as Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s far-right government kept expanding the   settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, boxing in the people of Gaza with a punitive blockade, and imposing an discriminatory and oppressive rule on millions of Palestinians under occupation that has been widely described as  ., If Joe Biden wants to rescue Israel-Saudi normalisation and the exclusionary  , if the US and Europe want to prevent a wider war drawing in Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iranian-backed, anti-Israel militias in Syria and Iraq, if the western democracies want to keep Russia (and China) from further extending regional influence, they must end the hands-off approach to the Palestinian question that has effectively empowered hardliners on all sides. Informal talks have already begun about establishing a national unity government to confront Israel\u2019s worst crisis since the 1973 Yom Kippur war \u2013 what its UN ambassador calls \u201cIsrael\u2019s 9/11\u201d. \u201cThe prime minister, who has prided himself on his vast political experience and irreplaceable wisdom in security matters, completely failed to identify the dangers he was consciously leading Israel into when establishing a government of annexation and dispossession,\u201d an editorial in the left-leaning Haaretz newspaper  ., In February 2021, a month after taking office, Biden did follow through on a campaign promise to release a long-delayed  , which directly blamed Prince Mohammed for Khashoggi\u2019s murder, noting that since 2017, he \u201chas had absolute control of the kingdom\u2019s security and intelligence organizations, making it highly unlikely that Saudi officials would have carried out an operation of this nature without the Crown Prince\u2019s authorization\u201d. Unlike Biden, Trump and senior members of his administration never wavered in their support for Prince Mohammed and the Saudi regime, even as the international outcry over Khashoggi\u2019s killing intensified. Prince Mohammed not only humiliated Biden but showed that he is in a stronger position today \u2013 and has more international suitors looking to curry his favor and win Saudi investments \u2013 than five years ago when he ordered Khashoggi\u2019s assassination., Even so, Biden seems to think he can win Israeli agreement for increased Palestinian autonomy, a halt to West Bank annexation plans and maybe a revived two-state peace process in return for delivering the Saudis, defanging   and providing security guarantees all round. After the  , Biden   The answer is that normalisation would represent a big pre-election win for the president, especially when linked to the third leg of his plan: advancing Palestinian statehood. Since taking office in 2021, US president  , mindful of recent, scarring American calamities and preoccupied by China and Ukraine, has mostly steered clear of continuing crises in the West Bank, Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Libya and Sudan., f you want proof Saudi Arabia is trying to improve its reputation, visit the website of the Saudi Tourism Authority. The majority owner of the news organisations, Evgeny Lebedev, sold a 30% stake in both in 2017 and 2018 to offshore companies fronted by a Saudi businessman, Sultan Muhammad Abuljadayel  The Standard and the Independent have stated they are unsure of who funds the businessman. It\u2019s mind-boggling to think that in 2018 the world was spitting with rage as gruesome details emerged of the   and Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi, a crime the CIA concluded was ordered by the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman., If you squint, you can still just about make out, through the continued existence of the football \u201cpyramid\u201d in particular, some meaningful connection between elite European soccer as a global entertainment product and the industrial communities that created the game as a working-class pastime and collectively developed it through a gradual, layered process over multiple generations into a permanent feature of popular culture alongside things like music, TV and film. Accelerating in the early 1990s, the successful commercialisation and marketisation to global TV audiences of a small number of powerful leagues led to an increased concentration of talent in England, Spain and Italy, directly at the expense of \u201csmaller\u201d leagues, which were turned into relative backwaters. If there is comfort to be drawn from the experience of football\u2019s past several decades, it is the limitless capacity of supporters to derive pleasure from the game and use it as the basis for meaningful connections with others \u2013 no matter how shamelessly wealthy interests have sought to exploit and co-opt our affection and enthusiasm., The Henderson controversy shows how the wealth of the Gulf states, and of Saudi Arabia in particular, is reshaping the sporting landscape and raising new questions about the relationship between sport and politics. According to the Campaign Against Arms Trade, since the start of the Saudi attack on Yemen, there has been almost   worth of arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Taking off the MBS-crafted designer blinkers, though, what we can see in Saudi Arabia is minor social reform undergirded by continuing political despotism and the crushing of any dissent., It has apparently used the US messaging app Snapchat to  , as the Guardian reported this week, while imposing draconian sentences on influencers who use social media to post any criticism of the future king, including a Leeds PhD student,  . The UK has now invited Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince and de facto leader, Mohammed bin Salman, whom the CIA believe   despite his denials,  . Some analysts have suggested that Prince Mohammed has learned his lesson in the light of the international backlash over Mr Khashoggi\u2019s murder, and is pursuing a more moderate path., Looking for an upside, analysts suggest Assad\u2019s return to the Arab fold, coupled with the   between his ally, Iran, and Saudi Arabia, may spawn a homegrown Middle East security order. Assad\u2019s Syria will remain deeply unstable whatever happens \u2013 divided between the partially Turkish-occupied north-west, where jihadists roam free; the Kurdish-governed north-east, viscerally hostile to Damascus; and the mostly regime-controlled centre and south. he   of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime \u2013 Syria\u2019s criminal president has been   in Saudi Arabia \u2013 makes sense to cynical Arab governments., At a Miami conference   in March, the tech entrepreneur Ben Horowitz enthused: \u201cHe\u2019s creating a new culture, he\u2019s creating a new vision for the country, he\u2019s got a very exciting plan to execute, and the people in the country are fired up to do it.\u201d Mr Biden fist-bumped the crown prince; in November, the administration told a US court that he   in a civil lawsuit over Mr Khashoggi\u2019s death. Cristiano Ronaldo took first place thanks to his move to the Saudi club Al-Nassr, while golfers Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson shot into the top 10 after joining the LIV Golf tour., If Saudi-Houthi talks make progress, Riyadh says the next step will be talks between the Houthis and the Presidential Leadership Council (PLC), to which President Hadi ceded his powers. Yet, since the agreement of a truce between the Saudi-led military coalition and Iran-backed Houthi rebels  , the country has seen a year of relative calm. Riyadh spearheaded the coalition supporting the internationally recognised government led by Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which had been ousted by the Houthis., The international community applied clumsy sanctions that did little but weaken the Sudanese people\u2019s capacity to resist their despotic government; a cynical cohort of undemocratic governments and monarchies in north Africa and the Middle East backed both the army and militia after the 2019 revolution, in order to extinguish the prospect of a democracy flourishing in their back yard; and lately, Russia has partnered   to extract gold and forge security interests. That was until a paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), and the country\u2019s army went to war over who runs the country \u2013 and trapped the Sudanese people between them. Slogans calling for democracy, even if they were momentarily chanted across the land, were soon drowned out by demands from the different factions, rebel groups, civilian parties and embedded elite interests who all had a different idea of the Sudan that should emerge after the revolution., Ayman Mohamed Saleh Al Sanabani is a Yemeni citizen and plaintiff in a lawsuit against  , the United Arab Emirates, the US state department, the US defense department, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics for human rights violations in Yemen This attack was just one of the thousands of indiscriminate bombings carried out on the people of Yemen by the   and a Saudi Arabia-led coalition since September 2015 under the guise of stopping Houthi rebels. It was a major departure from his predecessors, Donald Trump and Barack Obama, and it brought hope to Yemenis here and around the world, as well as international observers and human rights organizations and activists., Assuming the deal goes ahead \u2013 there are two months for details to be ironed out \u2013 the containment of Saudi-Iranian tensions will not necessarily lead to a deeper rapprochement, let alone end Lebanon\u2019s woes or   in Yemen. The huge cost and reputational damage of the Saudi intervention in Yemen (in support of the internationally recognised government) gave an initially gung-ho Riyadh pause too. He was describing Iran and Saudi Arabia\u2019s agreement last week   \u2013 a surprise to most observers, and something of a coup for China, which brokered it., In Iran, whose post-1979 democratic system is crumbling, Mojtaba Khamenei, son of the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is mentioned as a possible successor.  , President Daniel Ortega and his vice-president wife, Rosario Murillo, the world\u2019s most notorious revolutionary apostates, are said to be prepping their son, Laureano Ortega,  . The son of the Dear Leader, Kim Jong-il, and grandson of North Korea\u2019s founding father, Kim Il-sung, was clearly indicating that talk of regime change is pointless. Earlier this month, Kim Jong-un, North Korea\u2019s dictator, used an anniversary parade of long-range ballistic missiles as the intimidating backdrop for a sort of coming-out party for his  , who is thought to be 10 years old., The World Bank has  \u201ca deliberate depression \u2026 orchestrated by [an] elite that has long captured the state and lived off its economic rents\u201d, while poor and middle-class people bear the burden of the crisis. One small step forward would be for the UN Human Rights Council to launch a fact-finding mission on the port blast,   by bereaved relatives and civil society groups, despite cynicism about its prospects. Then, on 4 August 2020, a mammoth explosion at Beirut\u2019s port \u2013 one of the largest non-nuclear blasts ever seen \u2013\u00ad killed more than 200 people and injured thousands., Likewise, the west\u2019s failure to seriously address the Israel-Palestine conflict allowed Iran\u2019s hardliners to grow their influence with Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. The evident depth of anger and enmity felt within Iran\u2019s regime over Suleimani\u2019s killing and many other long-festering grievances is not wholly surprising, yet it should give western governments pause. A ceremony in Tehran last week marking the third anniversary of the assassination in Iraq by a US drone of Qassem Suleimani, a senior commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), conveyed a defiant message to the west., You wonder why the UK has not explored the possibility of using human rights sanctions against President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi\u2019s regime in Egypt, where torture by security officials is endemic, hundreds of people have been sentenced to death in mass trials for political offences and a British citizen, Alaa Abd el-Fattah, has been   for sharing a Facebook post. Just days ago, the Foreign Office was scrambling to withdraw comments by a minister, David Rutley, acknowledging that Saudi Arabian authorities had tortured a Jordanian father facing imminent execution,  by Saudi authorities. Cleverly cites the UK\u2019s use of sanctions against individuals and institutions in Russia, Iran and Myanmar, and few would object to a British foreign secretary taking a tough line on these regimes\u2019 abuses., Biden has failed to live up to his promise to put human rights   of his foreign policy, and a pledge during the 2020 presidential campaign to seek accountability for Khashoggi\u2019s murder, when  : \u201cUnder a Biden-Harris administration, we will reassess our relationship with the Kingdom, end US support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s war in Yemen, and make sure America does not check its values at the door to sell arms or buy oil.\u201d he Biden administration told a US judge last week that Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, should be   in a civil lawsuit over his role in the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Today, after nearly two years in power, the Biden administration is still   and military support to Saudi Arabia, and the US has now shielded the crown prince from any meaningful accountability for Khashoggi\u2019s killing., Prince Mohammed had clearly concluded that he can get away with keeping oil prices high and undermining the US and EU campaign to isolate Russia \u2013 and still secure US protection and military assistance because Biden can\u2019t get past the decades-old policy of American support for the House of Saud. This oil-for-security arrangement has lasted through Democratic and Republican administrations, including multiple crises like the Arab-led oil embargo and Opec price increases in the 1970s and the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, where 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals recruited by Al-Qaida. Since Prince Mohammed rose to power with his father\u2019s ascension to the Saudi throne in 2015, he has presided over a series of destructive policies, including the Saudi-led invasion of Yemen and the kingdom\u2019s   its smaller neighbor, Qatar., Biden wanted the Saudis and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) to boost, or at least maintain, oil production in order to counter Russia\u2019s use of gas and oil as weapons in the wider east-west struggle over Putin\u2019s Ukraine invasion. very picture tells a story, or so it\u2019s said, and the photo of a smirking Vladimir Putin   with the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, at the opening game of the men\u2019s football World Cup in Moscow in June 2018 carried a clear warning for the west. Most important, the US and the western democracies must demonstrate by their actions that the great 21st-century global battle for freedom, democracy, human dignity and international law, exemplified and symbolised by the fight for Ukraine, is too vitally important, too crucial, too epic, to be bartered away for a cheap barrel of oil., Further examination of my devices showed not only tracking by NSO\u2019s spyware, but also evidence that another spyware, Cellebrite, was implanted on my devices and downloaded all my communications with Jamal. In 2019, Dr Agn\u00e8s Callamard, the former UN special rapporteur who  , asked for his devices and was told by Turkish authorities that they were holding Jamal\u2019s phones and his computer as part of their investigation, and the examination of those devices were \u201congoing\u201d. I believe those devices will reveal previously undisclosed details about Jamal\u2019s murder that are critical to knowing the full truth and advancing the cause of justice., Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki al-Faisal was speaking as Anthony Joshua fought Ukraine\u2019s Oleksandr Usyk in Jeddah on Sunday \u2013 and one day after the United Nations human rights office denounced the   handed to Salma al-Shehab, a PhD student at Leeds University, for sharing Twitter messages. The international horror and condemnation at Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s murder at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul did not last long, despite the CIA   that it was ordered by Mohammed bin Salman; the country\u2019s crown prince and de facto ruler   responsibility. Mr Biden, who supposedly \u201creceived commitments\u201d that the kingdom had taken measures to prevent shocking human rights abuses in future, should also call for Ms Shehab\u2019s release., The answer is that the repressive Saudi regime and its crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman (who chairs the sovereign wealth fund and is widely believed to have ordered the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi), are increasingly using international sport to launder the kingdom\u2019s dire reputation for systemic  . To protest about the wretched plight of Salma al-Shehab, a Saudi PhD student at the University of Leeds, who has been   by a secretive Saudi terrorism court for 34 years \u2013 for the \u201ccrime\u201d of using Twitter. Yet Saudi Arabia\u2019s raised international profile also means there are more platforms, and more arenas, on which to highlight its intolerance for dissent, its mistreatment of Shia Muslims like Shehab, its   and its gaping, shaming democratic deficit., She\u2019s just an ordinary person with a Twitter account who, amongst tweets about her sons, occasionally retweeted people critical of Saudi Arabia and expressed support for the women\u2019s rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul, also thrown in jail by the regime. It\u2019s not surprising that the Post led the charge on this: Post Opinions contributor Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident, was brutally assassinated nearly four years ago and a US   found that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, approved his killing. The fact that Saudi Arabia was simultaneously jailing women\u2019s rights activists and bombing Yemen to smithereens, creating one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crises, got rather less play., Maybe Biden thought last week\u2019s volte-face, this mother of all U-turns, as another unlamented Middle East tyrant might have put it, would help reset US-Saudi ties, scare the Iranians \u2013 and  . \u201cWith respect to the murder of Khashoggi, I raised it at the top of the meeting, making it clear what I thought of it at the time and what I think about it now,\u201d a defensive Biden said later. When a president\u2019s  , as Biden\u2019s did last week, when most Democrats say he\u2019s too old to run again, and when inflation is driving maddened voters into the arms of opponents, the mind tends to mist up., It will gain added impetus in July when US president Joe Biden visits Israel and Saudi Arabia and comes as nuclear talks with Iran  . Tehran said last week it was  While improbable at this stage, a defusing of nuclear and Iran-Saudi tensions could have huge positive implications for Tehran\u2019s ties with Europe, the US and all its Arab neighbours. Biden will encourage normalisation of Israel-Saudi relations and seek to ease Palestinian tensions \u2013 he is due to visit the occupied West Bank., The UN needs just $20m more \u2013 chump change, in terms of international funding \u2013 to begin unloading more than a million barrels of oil from a fast-decaying tanker moored off the coast of Yemen, in the fragile ecosystem of the Red Sea. Even in crudely economic terms, $80m for the first and most crucial stage of the operation \u2013 transferring the oil to a safer ship \u2013 looks like an indisputable bargain. Around a tenth of the world\u2019s shipping goes through the Bab el-Mandeb strait, which could be hit by the spill at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars a day., But that will not worry the Saudis, who offered a too-tempting $4m (\u00a33.2m) in prize money to the first   individual winner from a pot worth $20m. The lure of hard cash, overriding competitive, political and ethical considerations, is what drives Salman\u2019s global soft power strategy \u2013 a strategy that is rapidly transforming, distorting, and weaponising international sport. After the Saudi journalist and regime critic, Jamal Khashoggi, was murdered in 2018, Joe Biden declared Saudi Arabia a pariah state and refused to meet Salman. The Saudi soft power strategy aims for enhanced international status, investment and influence against the backdrop of Salman\u2019s \u201cVision 2030\u201d national modernisation plan.","The only alternative is for Israel to destroy Hamas, which not only frees Israelis from the constant fear of terror attacks but also frees Palestinians from the regime of corruption, tyranny and death that has governed the Gaza Strip since Hamas took power in 2007. We have seen countless videos of people who harbor deep resentment toward Israel and Jews angrily tearing down posters that show the faces and share the stories of innocent Americans and Israelis taken hostage by Hamas.\u00a0  Tlaib committed blood libel by falsely accusing Israel of striking a hospital, fueling the fire at the same time Jews across the world were under siege and Israel\u2019s embassies in the Middle East were being attacked.\u00a0\u00a0 , I grew up part of an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in Jerusalem, attending ultra-Orthodox Jewish schools. My former community drilled into us an important lesson: no matter what the whole world thinks, no matter what people around us say, we have to be upright and strong and do the right thing, even when it\u2019s not popular.\u00a0    My former community drilled into us an important lesson: no matter what the whole world thinks, no matter what people around us say, we have to be upright and strong and do the right thing, even when it\u2019s not popular.\u00a0 , The people of Gaza, after voting for Hamas, live within a terror war machine and sadly, we must recognize that they continue to support Hamas and its atrocities.\u00a0\u00a0  In an audio clip released by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on social media, an IDF soldier urges a Gaza resident to head south, but the resident, identified as Muhammad, claims Hamas is forcing everyone to stay north. The immoral and false comparisons between Israel, a law-abiding democracy, and Hamas, an internationally designated terror group, that we are seeing at the UN and in the media now is exactly what the terrorists want.\u00a0 , While the Abraham Accords may not directly mitigate the immediate crisis, they offer a long-term framework that isolates malign actors like Iran and Hamas, giving Israel strategic depth and diplomatic leverage it didn\u2019t have before. This audacious attack shines a glaring spotlight on the failures of the Biden administration\u2019s foreign policy, the unholy alliance between Iran and Hamas, and the global implications that reach as far as Beijing.\u00a0  Despite the theological divide between Iran\u2019s Shiite theocracy and Hamas\u2019 radical Sunni ideology, their common goal of annihilating Israel unites them.\u00a0 , And then there are those who don\u2019t even try to defend Israel \u2013 they just throw up their hands in defeat, arguing that we must cut loose anti-Israel sentiment from the definition of antisemitism \u2013 in other words, condone anti-Zionism as the price for leaving American Jews alone.\u00a0  Some experts posit that misperceptions of Israel and its policies are the root cause of the rise in antisemitism and push for greater education on Israel and the risks it faces from its enemies.\u00a0  He has guided unprecedented advancements in the US-Israel relationship, including moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem and brokering the Abraham Accords \u2014 peace agreements between Israel and five Muslim Nations \u2014 for which he was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize and awarded the National Security Medal., When the fighting resumes, we are forced to wonder: what good is a humanitarian pause for aid if the killing doesn\u2019t stop? To say that the situation is exceptional does not begin to describe the reality of nonstop Israeli bombardments, huge missile strikes from air, land, and sea, and the collective struggle to stay alive. If you want to give aid and be humanitarian then the killing must stop, through an immediate ceasefire., My organisation, Standing Together, a grassroots political movement of Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel,   to help the thousands of Arab workers  , and the many Arab students facing disciplinary charges in their universities. That is why we\u2019ve formed the Jewish-Arab Solidarity Network with more than 12 local groups in cities across the country, which works on the ground to combat racism, promote peace and equality, and bring Jewish and Palestinian citizens together. Uri Weltmann is the national field organiser of  , a grassroots political movement of Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel that organises for peace, equality and social justice, Operationally, this could entail forming an Arab-Palestinian Authority-international peacekeeping force to take over from Israeli forces after Hamas\u2019s defeat, unifying the West Bank and Gaza Strip under PA control, reviving Israeli-Palestinian negotiations over a final status settlement, and promoting regional security and stability by pursuing normalisation with Riyadh along with a massive injection of Saudi or Gulf moneys to rebuild the devastated Strip. However, putting aside the more extreme voices seeking to permanently depopulate the Strip or nuke it to oblivion, two largely consensual goals can be adduced from the Israeli stance so far: the first is that Hamas must be unequivocally defeated and its military and political-civilian presence uprooted from Gaza once and for all; and the second, that there should be no return to the status quo ante \u2013 that is, that any post-Hamas regime must be consistent with Israel\u2019s security needs and the trauma suffered by the Israeli people on 7 October. All have been born from Gaza\u2019s searing 75-year-old experience with brute Israeli force, from mowing down refugees seeking to return to their homes and fields in the \u201cGaza envelope\u201d after 1948 through the massacres of unarmed protesters during the first Israeli occupation of 1956, Ariel Sharon\u2019s brutal \u201cpacification\u201d campaign in 1970-71, the era of settler occupation up to 2005, the dozen Israeli operations against Gaza   the 2005 withdrawal, to the siege and repeated bloody assaults since., Mr Netanyahu leads the most rightwing government in Israel\u2019s history: one minister recently   dropping a nuclear bomb on Gaza. This political strategy sought through unassailable military strength to end claims for an independent Palestinian state over the West Bank and Gaza with a capital city in East Jerusalem. Unfortunately, he is more likely to hear the words of his younger brother, Iddo, who   last Thursday that only the urgent \u201cterrible fear of our power\u201d could pacify Palestinians, rather than Israel waiting for them to rid themselves of \u201cabysmal hatred\u201d., Biden has spent most of his presidency   confrontation with Israeli leaders after his former boss, then president Barack Obama, was burned by his   With another presidential race against Donald Trump looming, it\u2019s difficult to imagine that Biden will be spending much political capital on the Israel-Palestinian conflict. That\u2019s a convenient narrative about a complex process that, among other things, ignores the part many people believe Netanyahu and the Israeli right played in  , who signed the Oslo accords \u2013 the first big crisis of the peace process. In the wake of the Hamas cross-border attack from Gaza, and the Israeli assault on the Palestinian enclave in response, President Joe Biden is punting the peace process back on to the agenda., But Labour has been   ever since Sir Keir Starmer appeared to say that\u00a0Israel had the right to impose a siege on Gaza, cutting off water and electricity, after the horrific massacre by Hamas of 1,400 Israelis. Sir Keir justifies war in northern Gaza in order to destroy Hamas. A human rights lawyer, Sir Keir could not say whether Israel had broken international law or whether its actions were morally justifiable., Julie, alongside Dr Lindsay Simmonds, a Jewish academic who researches women of faith and peacebuilding, felt the need to create a third space outside religious institutions and political organisations. \u201cIt takes courage and vulnerability to come into a space like this,\u201d said Julie Siddiqi, the Muslim co-organiser and a faith-relations consultant. \u201cThink of the  , or  , a grassroots initiative in Israel and Palestine comprising thousands of Palestinian and Israeli women, who even now continue to work for peace on the ground., One senior Labour party member described the resignation of Labour councillors in response to the party\u2019s position on Gaza as \u201cshaking off the fleas\u201d. I am told by a senior Labour insider that the Palestine issue is already being analysed solely in terms of which Muslim seats could swing away from Labour, and where wild card candidates can swoop in, campaign and win on this single issue, as George Galloway did in the past. However, I spoke to Azim Ahmed, the secretary general of the Muslim Council of Wales, and he told me of a community now even more angry at Labour, because of how the visit was instrumentalised; and of the resulting damage to the relationship between local party representatives and Westminster., Before 7 October, Gaza received some 500 trucks of food and other supplies every day, including 45 trucks of fuel to power the strip\u2019s cars, water desalination plants and bakeries. An immediate humanitarian ceasefire must be enacted to allow safe, continuous and unrestricted access to fuel, medicine, water and food in the Gaza Strip. Nearly 600,000 people are sheltering in 150 schools and other UNRWA buildings, living in unsanitary conditions with limited clean water, little food and medicines., The Israel and Palestine conflict is not fundamentally a Muslim or Jewish issue, it is a human rights issue, but the conflict disproportionately affects Muslims and Jews across the world and here in the UK, where people live in increasing fear of hate crimes and for our wellbeing and safety. In an   on 11 October, pressed on whether Israel\u2019s siege of Gaza \u2013 cutting off power and water \u2013 was appropriate, he said: \u201cI think that Israel does have that right, it is an ongoing situation. I was saying that Israel has the right to self-defence, and when I said that right I meant it was that right to self-defence., Despite being a proud Palestinian who supports oppressed communities and actively speaks out against Israeli occupation and colonialism, this attack on Israeli civilians does not align with my beliefs \u2013 I condemn killing civilians and deeply mourn the loss of lives among Palestinians and Israelis. Supporting Palestine does not equate to antisemitism \u2013 advocating for ending Israeli aggression against Palestine doesn\u2019t imply forgetting the historical experiences and pain of the Jewish people. According to B\u2019Tselem, the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories: \u201cThe Israeli regime enacts in all the territory it controls an apartheid regime.\u201d, Kobi Shabtai, Israel\u2019s police chief, translated the policies of the hawkish and nationalist government into orders to the police force, and stated quite clearly that he will not tolerate any form of protest that is supportive of the people in the Gaza Strip: \u201c \u201d His boss, the minister of national security, Itamar Ben-Gvir,   warning all Jewish nationals about their Arab fellow citizens, as if he is not also their minister. For many Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel, who comprise 20% of our population, family members and loved ones in Gaza have been killed, injured or are still surviving horrifying living conditions. The Arab-Palestinian minority within Israel is at the same time part of the Palestinian people as well as citizens of Israel., The Palestinian Authority, the Israeli occupation\u2019s subcontractor in the West Bank, cracks down on dissent with the same enthusiasm as Israel, with journalists and activists  Just this week, Palestinian Authority security forces   in Jenin and injured dozens of people across the West Bank after opening fire on protesters who came out in support of Gaza. In the first eight months of 2023, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) recorded a daily average of   a day on Palestinians in the West Bank, killing and injuring Palestinians, damaging their property, and preventing them from moving to reach their lands, workplaces, families and friends. Israeli settlers opened fire at residents and rather than hold them back, as Israeli forces claim to do, they joined in.   were killed that day, with settlers killing three and soldiers killing one., Prime minister for most of the last 15 years, Netanyahu has been an enabler of Hamas, building up the organisation, letting it rule Gaza unhindered \u2013 save for brief, periodic military operations against it \u2013 and allowing funds from its Gulf patrons to keep it flush. Netanyahu liked the idea of the Palestinians as a house divided \u2013 Fatah in the West Bank, Hamas in Gaza \u2013 because it allowed him to insist that there was no Palestinian partner he could do business with. Not for nothing did the scholar Hussein Ibish  : \u201cIn trying to fulfil the pledge to \u2018eliminate Hamas\u2019, Israel could well deliver everything Hamas is counting on.\u201d, After showing condolences and sympathy, Biden \u2013 and any influential friend of Israel, for that matter \u2013 should really be focusing on three basic tasks: holding Israel to account for its own war crimes against Palestinians; reflecting on how those crimes contribute to the lack of security for Israelis themselves; and demanding that Israel go back to peace negotiations, this time ensuring equal footing for Palestinians in a way that would truly guarantee an end to apartheid. Living under a regime that local and international   and UN reports   \u201capartheid\u201d, Palestinians are treated as second-class citizens within Israel itself, are subjected to a racist and brutal military regime in the West Bank, and are suffocating in the world\u2019s largest open-air prison in the besieged Gaza Strip, which is also routinely bombarded by Israel. He wished to reaffirm his government\u2019s complete support for the Israeli government, to repeat the warning to surrounding states against intervening in the Israel-Gaza war, and to ask that his hosts offer some humanitarian relief for Palestinian civilians in the besieged Strip, which they continue to bomb intensely ahead of the planned ground invasion., grew up in the south of   with my parents and four siblings in a small village called Netiv Haasara, which is one of the closest Israeli villages to the Gaza Strip. Both my parents \u2013 my beloved wonderful parents, Yakov and Bilha Inon \u2013 are now dead. Swimming in the sea, picking oranges with my mother from the many orchards, running around in the wheat and corn fields my father helped to grow, picking wild mushrooms and looking for big snails in the winter \u2013 I have so many fond memories., I know plenty of people who are deeply engaged in politics, not (yet) despairing of British democracy, determined to vote at the next election, but who are also finding contact with news media distressing to the point of physical repellence. That isn\u2019t a claim of special sensitivity to the horror of what is happening in Israel and Gaza, just an explanation for why I find myself particularly torn right now between the duty to be informed and the impulse to recoil from the process of getting informed; and also why I crave meaningful arguments amid a frenzy of pointless ones. But right now, with waves of fear and fury radiating out of the  , it feels important to recognise a difference between communication that increases understanding and its opposite; between words used as tools to assemble meaningful propositions and words brandished as weapons and decoys., Biden will seek to persuade Israeli leaders to adopt rules of war that minimize civilian harm, but it\u2019s unclear how far Israel\u2019s government can or will go to protect civilian life for as long as it maintains its goal of destroying Hamas. Biden is betting that effusive public solidarity with Israel \u2013 a strategy the administration calls \u201c \u201d \u2013 will give him the credibility to influence the calculations of Israel\u2019s leaders in private. Another purpose of Biden\u2019s trip is to send a strong signal to Iran and groups such as Hezbollah that if they enter the conflict against Israel, they are likely to also find themselves fighting the United States., Even in the Middle East itself, Biden has paid more attention to Saudi Arabia and Iran than to Israel-Palestine. All this may help to explain why, since becoming president in 2021, Biden has been reluctant to spend political capital on an Israel-Palestine dispute that once absorbed so much US presidential time and effort. But the collapse of Biden\u2019s Amman meeting is a serious blow to this strategy, as is the widespread regional dismissal of Israel\u2019s denial of responsibility for the hospital attack., It\u2019s a country where a Muslim mayor of London who has managed these last days with exemplary grace can break bread in a   in Golders Green one day and visit the London office of a   in Gaza\u2019s hospitals the next; where the wife of the Scottish first minister, Nadia El-Nakla, can speak emotionally of   for her parents\u2019 lives while introducing a motion to the SNP\u2019s conference that both unequivocally condemns the Hamas attacks and calls on Israel to respect international law in response. Already the British hard right is seizing on images of pro-Palestinian rallies across Europe, or diatribes by wannabe student politicians to proclaim the supposed grand failure of multiculturalism, or the idea that society is enriched by different groups being able to maintain their own religious and cultural traditions (within the confines of the law). Where mainstream critics of multiculturalism used to argue that there were better ways of living alongside each other in a pluralistic world, its new opponents bellow that no such world is possible; that mass immigration has broken the west, and that citizenship should be revoked from those already here if they express unacceptable views., It remains to be seen if that is Israel\u2019s plan after it ordered more than one million people to get out of northern Gaza as the military prepares further attacks in addition to the bombing and shelling that has already killed 2,700 Palestinians, including 700 children. In different ways, the sentiment that the Palestinians are collectively responsible for the actions of Hamas in killing of about 1,300 Israelis and  of 199 \u2013 and therefore deserve what is coming to them \u2013 has been echoed far beyond Israel\u2019s borders. For years, Israeli leaders have advocated ethnic cleansing, euphemistically called \u201ctransfer\u201d, with a discourse that portrays Palestinians as a fake people with no history that matters., The words that  , then head of the Palestine Red Crescent in Gaza, addressed to the Israeli people 32 years ago at the Madrid peace conference came suddenly to mind: \u201cWe, the people of Palestine, stand before you in the fullness of our pain, our pride and our anticipation, for we have long harboured a yearning for peace and a dream of justice and freedom.\u201d And yet almost immediately after signing the agreement, Israel pursued a policy of severing ties between the West Bank and Gaza, and each from Israel, for example by making   increasingly difficult for Palestinians and Israelis. I have heard the Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, say that his country is fighting against \u201c \u201d, and I have seen the aftermath of the indiscriminate killings of civilians committed by Hamas militants in southern Israel., To suggest that such butchery represents the Palestinian struggle is to demean the Palestinian people and their battle for freedom and rights, to view them in the same way as do those Israeli politicians and western commentators who talk of \u201canimals\u201d and \u201csavages\u201d. \u201cAnyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas,\u201d Netanyahu reportedly   in 2019. Not a liberal peacenik speaking from the safety of London or Washington but Yaakov Argamani, whose daughter Noa was taken hostage by Hamas at a   on Israel\u2019s border with Gaza., Allow the fallacious narrative that Zionists dropped out of a clear blue sky to occupy someone else\u2019s country, and you would still expect some inhalation of breath, some space for shock or sorrow, some admission that when they shouted, \u201cFrom the river to the sea, Palestine shall be free\u201d, even the most fervent anti-Zionists never envisaged freedom-taking in quite so bloody a form. But understand that the sight of Israelis who just happen to be Jews being manhandled into cars and driven away into captivity stirs memories of events that Jews hoped never to be caught up in again. And it\u2019s very likely that they taught their children from the cradle to despise all Jews, for that was no occasional, skin-deep animosity enacted in southern   last week., I worked as a journalist in the region in the 1990s, and in recent years I have spent a great deal of time in Gaza and Israel, researching the history of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million refugees. As with Israel\u2019s expulsions in 1948, today\u2019s leadership will then project a narrative saying that there is no safe future for Israel unless the entire population of Gaza is permanently expelled. Since Israel and Egypt blockaded Gaza in 2006-7, cutting it off from the world, Israel has seen reason to hope that the story of 1948 would remain hidden, too., Unlike most communities in Israel, Kfar Aza lay within walking distance of the territory controlled by a terrorist group committed to killing all Jews and to the destruction of the world\u2019s only Jewish state. On the day we visited, Kfar Aza was an oasis of tranquillity, home to compassionate and peaceful people who just wanted to live their lives. Since   had taken control of the Gaza Strip, the people of Kfar Aza had lived under the constant threat of terror., Despite the paltry numbers, the interaction symbolised the same pro- or anti-Netanyahu breakdown that had caused Israel\u2019s political paralysis for four election cycles in a row \u2013 until a fifth poll finally yielded a fanatical, theocratic, proto-authoritarian government led by Netanyahu, despite his indictments on  .   The pro-Netanyahu camp is already insisting that the far right must be even more extreme, while the anti-Netanyahu camp finds it inconceivable that Netanyahu should remain in power after the catastrophe that has occurred on his watch. The Palestinian uprising of September 2000, known as the  , prompted a rise in the proportion of Israeli Jews who  , according to my survey research over the years; this was accelerated by Israel\u2019s unilateral withdrawal from Gaza, followed by Hamas\u2019s takeover in 2007., In one rendition, everything that occurred on 7 October owes to the Israeli occupation of Palestinians \u2013 the Gaza Strip, though under siege, isn\u2019t occupied by Israel, unlike the West Bank \u2013 and Hamas\u2019s attack was therefore righteous resistance against oppression. Yet despite the horrors the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam visited on Israeli civilians, Gazans are not animals, any more than are their counterparts in Israel. That Hamas also attacked Israeli soldiers and military bases is irrelevant: killing civilians was integral to their aim, not incidental or unintentional., On Monday, the EU commissioner Oliv\u00e9r V\u00e1rhelyi unexpectedly declared \u2013   \u2013 a freeze on EU development assistance to the Palestinians worth \u20ac690m. The scale of terror against Israel was \u201ca turning point\u201d, V\u00e1rhelyi wrote. The ultimate responsibility for further EU aid delivery lies with the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, who has a reputation for tight centralisation of power within the Brussels executive, but allowed a surprising degree of leeway to the Hungarian commissioner\u2019s freelancing. On the contrary, Israeli officials have always   international donors to continue the flow of aid to Palestinian territories, including to Gaza, because it effectively subsidises Israel\u2019s occupation and blockade, and has helped to ensure relative stability., Hamas seemed to offer the Israeli right the best of all worlds: relieving Israel of the need to govern the Gaza Strip, without making any peace offers that might dislocate Israeli control of the West Bank. Second, a coalition of the willing \u2013 ranging from the US and the EU to Saudi Arabia and the Palestinian Authority \u2013 should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip away from Hamas, rebuild Gaza and simultaneously completely disarm Hamas and demilitarise the Gaza Strip. The remnants of the Israeli left hoped that the Palestinians would make an honest attempt to turn Gaza into a prosperous and peaceful city state, a Middle Eastern Singapore, showing to the world and to the Israeli right what the Palestinians could do when given the opportunity to govern themselves., A friend\u2019s uncle hiding under a capsized boat; a friend\u2019s friend listened over the phone as her sister\u2019s family was murdered; a friend\u2019s nephew killed at a rave, a cousin\u2019s daughter escaped the same rave by the skin of her teeth. The only thing that comes to my mind are the words of French,Jewish philosopher Emmanuel Levinas, which I came across in my research into communication with the \u201cother\u201d, whether through laughter or any other embodiment of experience: \u201cThe face of the other in its precariousness and defencelessness is for me at once the temptation to kill and the call for peace, the \u2018thou shall not kill\u2019.\u201d Maya pulled a face and waved her hand dismissively but then, almost automatically, got up and led the way to the \u201csafe space\u201d on the stairs, where my family, with the other neighbours in the eight-floor building, gathered, and we waited for the explosion sound that told us we could go back to the flat., \u201cSocial media companies, particularly those that style themselves forums for free speech, have a moral obligation to try to ensure the free flow of reliable information to desperate users facing mortal risk,\u201d said Suzanne Nossel, chief executive of PEN America, which advocates for free expression. As Hamas announced that it intends to begin killing civilian hostages and broadcasting executions in audio and video, Clara Jeffery, editor-in-chief of Mother Jones, foresaw more trouble: \u201cI want everyone to realize that Elon has set up his site so that these snuff videos will be monetized for his blue checks.\u201d Not long after buying Twitter, Musk got rid of most of the Twitter content moderation staff that had tried to keep things as accurate as possible by flagging fake accounts and attaching warnings., As of Monday, the ministry of health in Gaza reported about 700 Palestinians killed by Israeli airstrikes and also thousands injured, with an additional 15 lives lost in the West Bank. The attack was immediately followed by the imposition of a full lockdown, which tightens the grip on the daily lives of the West Bank\u2019s residents, restricting our movements and intensifying the limitations on access to essential services and resources. Images of the torment and brutal killings of hundreds of   bring back memories of the violence and humiliation suffered by Palestinians, including children, women, elderly and disabled people, over many years., The intelligence system, which surveils every aspect of Palestinians\u2019 lives in Gaza and the West Bank, had no prior knowledge of the attack; civilians were left defenceless for many hours against Hamas militants, who trapped them in their homes and   without military intervention \u2013 the same military tasked with protecting every settler in the West Bank at any given moment. On Saturday night, after hours of anxious staring at the television and social media, my daughter was panicked by the fear that Hamas militants, armed and still inside Israeli territory, might make their way to Jerusalem and attack us in our home. Terrible crimes were committed against Israelis this Saturday, crimes that the mind cannot fathom \u2013 and in this time of dark grief, I cling to the one thing I have left to hold on to: my humanity., A   is no fix for the political crisis begat by a moribund Palestinian leadership which lacks both power and legitimacy \u2013 and, above all, by Mr Netanyahu, who has overseen massive settlement expansion, handed extreme nationalists and overt racists not only a veneer of respectability but key positions, and promised annexation. Israel Defence Forces raids have soared; this summer saw the   on the West Bank in two decades. Just over a week ago, President Biden\u2019s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan,  : \u201cThe Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades.\u201d, For the extreme right in Israel, this is also an opportunity to escalate tensions between Israel and the West Bank, the other Palestinian territory between the west bank of the River Jordan and the eastern frontier of Israel, as members of the Knesset openly speak about large-scale expulsion of Palestinians as a desired outcome. While Netanyahu agreed to some easing of pressure on Gaza, he was unwilling to accept Hamas\u2019s long-term demands, including a large-scale prisoner swap, lifting the siege by opening the international border crossing, and establishing a port and airport in Gaza. Israel had rebuffed Egypt\u2019s earlier offers for a negotiated withdrawal from Sinai, and the Egyptian president, Anwar Sadat, believed that a limited military achievement would shift the balance of power and bring Israel to the negotiating table., Supporters of the judicial overhaul \u2013 who, by all polls, are only a minority of the furthest rightwing Israelis \u2013 hope the government will now have unfettered power to annex the West Bank, expand settlements, deepen the hold of strict Jewish religious observance in Israeli life and reinstate corrupt politicians, especially one who had been ousted when the court ruled his appointment \u201cextremely unreasonable\u201d \u2013 the very legal reasoning that last week\u2019s legislation will stifle. Pro-democracy supporters will have to face uncomfortable truths about how undemocratic Israel has been for most of its history \u2013 from the military government that ruled its own Arab citizens in the first 20 years to the occupation authorities governing Palestinians which took over where the first military regime left off. Our train arrived at the tail end of a massive rightwing demonstration in Tel Aviv, with people who also flooded in from around the country and the West Bank, to   the government\u2019s plans., Thanks to the law passed this week, that could mean an attempt either to sack the attorney general or strip her of authority over prosecutions, clearing the way for a new, more sympathetic official who might \u2013 purely coincidentally, you understand \u2013 decide to review existing cases, before concluding that all charges against Netanyahu should be dropped and the trial halted. Polish and Hungarian campaigners recognise in Netanyahu\u2019s drive to turn Israel into an illiberal democracy the transformation wreaked in their own countries. In other words, despite massive economic and civil disruption and a mutiny that military officials warn has seriously degraded Israel\u2019s ability to defend itself, Netanyahu went ahead anyway., Their political parties are the bulwarks of the government: Religious Zionism, which   an ideology of Jewish supremacy, and United Torah Judaism, which wants the ultra-Orthodox way of life undisturbed and subsidised. The   allies of Mr Netanyahu have been growing in political significance due to the unchecked expansion of illegal settlements in the occupied territories and the sharply rising ultra-Orthodox population. Israel\u2019s social contract has already been broken in part by rising  : a fifth of Israelis live below the national poverty line, but so do almost half of the ultra-Orthodox \u2013 and a third of Arab Israelis., How refreshing it was to see that torrent of people slowly pouring down the hillside outside Jerusalem, composed of hundreds of thousands of Israelis of all ethnicities and all ages, supporters of different political parties, people who founded \u2013 or whose foremothers and forefathers founded \u2013 the state, and who will absolutely not give up on their dream. As if the awareness that has been dulled for so many years has suddenly been awakened, we now comprehend the responsibility \u2013 no, the culpability \u2013 of the self-proclaimed agents of Jewish history who brought about the state\u2019s greatest disaster: the settlement enterprise. The deception perpetrated by Simcha Rothman (member of the Knesset for the far-right Religious Zionist party), the justice minister,  , the security minister,   and Benjamin Netanyahu is, ultimately, just the artist\u2019s signature in the corner of the big picture., When a settler group rampaged through Huwara in revenge for a Palestinian gun attack, torching homes and cars in what an Israeli general called a  , Bezalel Smotrich, the   who also oversees settler life in the West Bank, said the village  . While the UN humanitarian office expressed concern at the scale of the operation, including airstrikes on an area densely populated with civilians, the US merely said that it supported Israel\u2019s security and right to defend its people. srael has portrayed its strikes on the Jenin refugee camp \u2013 the biggest military operation in the occupied West Bank for two decades \u2013 as a limited intervention  ., Sure enough, the resulting power vacuum has been filled by local West Bank groups of young militants, exemplified by the so-called Jenin brigades, pursuing armed resistance for lack of a credible political process. he endlessly simmering conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, exploding into   this week in the embattled West Bank city of Jenin, threatens a broader, more far-reaching catastrophe. Parliamentary support from national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, finance minister Bezalel Smotrich and their allies keeps Netanyahu in office.  , In recent years, even as Israel\u2019s consolidation of apartheid has become increasingly blatant, Europe and the United States have continued to pressure Palestinians to accept a two-state solution that perpetuates inequality and suffering, with no regard to our right to self-determination and without any serious effort to stop settlement building. This includes dozens of illegal settlements, the construction of a segregation wall (most of which was built on Palestinian land), and an Israeli political discourse that stresses there will only be one state \u2013 a \u201cJewish state\u201d \u2013 between the Jordan River and Mediterranean Sea. A growing number of Palestinians believe that the only solution left is a single democratic state on the whole of historic Palestine without occupation, apartheid or discrimination., This week I spoke to  , who warned that while some have said Netanyahu\u2019s changes would turn Israel into Turkey or Hungary, it would be much worse than that: \u201cHungary is still a member of the European Union. A government with unlimited power, with no supreme court standing in its way, would face no obstacle if it moved towards theocracy, as some in the coalition wish, or if it decided to annex the West Bank while granting no citizenship or rights to the millions of Palestinians who live there. Israel\u2019s occupation is now in its 56th year, and that has been a disaster for the Palestinians most obviously, but it has also been a calamity for Israel itself., What ultimately brought the country to standstill, what brought thousands of Israelis almost spontaneously out of their beds and onto the streets late Sunday night, was Netanyahu\u2019s firing of his defense minister Yoav Gallant, after Gallant warned that the scale of protest against the judicial overhaul plan within the army was putting Israel\u2019s military capacities and security at risk. The protest movement will either transform into a call for genuine democracy \u2013 for Palestinians and Israelis alike \u2013 or it will remain locked in the current impasse, in the chaotic push-and-pull between the forces of the status quo and the forces of the extreme right that the status quo has produced. Now, the hard right wants to move beyond managing the occupation toward what some of its politicians, like finance minister Betzalel Smotrich, call a \u201cdecisive\u201d moment \u2013 toward the final defeat of the Palestinian national movement, the de jure annexation of the West Bank and the expulsion of the Palestinians living there., Whether or not it materialises, sceptics note that Mr Ben-Gvir is bigger on rhetoric than delivery, and that Mr Netanyahu will not want him to have his own armed power base \u2013 the pledge to hand a man   of inciting racism a   is inherently horrifying. And though the court has repeatedly undercut Palestinian rights in the West Bank and helped to entrench the occupation, the prime minister\u2019s far-right coalition partners are angered by even its modest rulings outlawing Israeli settlements. He could back off \u2013 for now \u2013 on allowing the Knesset to override the supreme court with a simple majority, while  on increasing political control of judicial selection and preventing the court from having oversight of basic laws \u2013 elements that have already passed a first reading., The recent   by Netanyahu\u2019s coalition government consists of curtailing judicial review of legislation, changes to the makeup of the judicial selection committee designed to ensure the government controls appointments to the bench, cancellation of supreme court intervention in cases of extremely unreasonable executive orders, and the transformation of ministerial legal advisers into political appointees. Foreign pressure may provide the more moderate elements of the governing coalition with a ladder to climb down, before Israel heads into the abyss and wreaks havoc in the Middle East. This emigration shock will have far-ranging consequences, as there are large, weaker sectors that essentially live off the strength of the hi-tech sector, which contributes 25% of Israel\u2019s income tax revenues., When examined together, the is currently legislating have one simple meaning (and you don\u2019t need a PhD in law to get it): if these laws are passed, the government will have the power to completely destroy our freedom.  of Knesset [ ] could pass any racist, oppressive and anti-democratic law they think of; 61 members of Knesset could also change the electoral system, to stop us from replacing the regime. Democracy is a deal, according to which citizens must respect the government\u2019s decisions, on the condition that the government respects the basic liberties of the citizens. When we ask the leaders of this coup what will keep the power of the government in check under the new regime, and what will protect basic human rights, they only have one answer: \u201ctrust us\u201d., Beyond that extreme scenario, Israel has two paths: in one version, the pro-democratic, moderate right, centre and leftwing elements make newfound common cause and win the next elections; they may not solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but they can preserve Israel\u2019s institutions and international positioning. Earlier rightwing governments merely wanted to expand settlements or annex parts of the West Bank, deepen the hold of Jewish religious law over Israeli public and private life, harangue and intimidate Israel\u2019s Palestinian-Arab citizens. With the coalition\u2019s firm parliamentary majority, the Knesset has already passed the first reading of a bill to give the coalition control over judicial appointments and ban judicial review of Israel\u2019s Basic Laws (which serve as a type of constitution)., I spent half the trip with Labour Friends of Israel, a grouping of like-minded Labour MPs, and half with the New Israel Fund, an NGO that funds organisations that promote democracy and equality for all Israelis, based on the vision of Israel\u2019s founders. There are so many wonderful things about Israel but the deeply anti-democratic proposals being considered by Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s new  , alongside a renewed assault on the homes and most basic rights of Palestinians living in the occupied territories, will only deepen division and heighten tensions. Netanyahu\u2019s government plans to undermine judicial independence by instituting the political appointment of judges and introducing a new \u201coverriding\u201d clause, allowing any decision by the supreme court of Israel to be overridden by a simple majority vote in the Knesset., Although this bureaucratic reorganisation of Israeli rule over the West Bank does not amount to legislative annexation \u2013 which the Israeli parliament did in the cases of East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights \u2013 the impact on the lives of Palestinians is the same. A recent example of this is the Israeli parliament\u2019s  , with an overwhelming majority, that empowers the interior minister to revoke the Israeli citizenship or residency status of political prisoners convicted of terror offences who receive financial aid from the Palestinian Authority. undreds of Israeli settlers descended on Sunday night on the Palestinian town of Huwara near Nablus in the West Bank., Siac, the tribunal that hears immigration cases involving national security issues, upheld the right of the home secretary \u2013 Sajid Javid in 2019 \u2013 to strip her of UK citizenship because her presence was not \u201cconducive to the public good\u201d. Ms Begum\u2019s case reveals that the Tories view the law not as a fundamental part of the UK\u2019s constitutional system, but as an unnecessary obstacle to the exercise of executive power. They had been   by the supreme court to only considering Ms Begum\u2019s appeal in terms of whether the process had been fair and  , rather than let judges try the case again., Dispossession and discrimination have been a longstanding reality here in the eastern part of the city, under Israeli military occupation for 56 years, but under the new far-right Israeli government, Jerusalem has seen a spike in demolitions \u2013 more than 30 structures were   in January alone. Most Palestinian homes are targeted for lacking a permit; indeed, in my city, at least   lack an Israeli-issued permit, putting 100,000 residents of occupied East Jerusalem at risk of forcible displacement at any given moment. In fact, since Israel\u2019s occupation of East Jerusalem began in 1967, virtually   for Palestinian neighbourhoods.   have been built for Jewish Israelis in the eastern part of the city, while   were built for Palestinians with any kind of government support., Kahneman was not speaking about a foreign army massing on the country\u2019s borders, an Iranian nuclear bomb or the gathering prospect of a   (though we\u2019ll get to that), but rather something Israel is doing to itself: what Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, gently calls his  , but what others describe as the evisceration of the Israeli courts, handing unchecked power to the government. That could, in turn, prompt a sea change among Palestinian-Israelis, a recognition that a de facto boycott of Israel\u2019s political institutions might have made sense when a separate Palestinian state seemed on the horizon, but makes no sense now. Their objection is to a plan that would limit the supreme court\u2019s power to strike down the decisions of politicians, allow Netanyahu or any future prime minister to override a court ruling by a simple majority in parliament, and make judges the handpicked appointments of politicians., With no viable path to their own state, Palestinians see settlements consume ever more land and little prospect of change to conditions which Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and a UN rapporteur \u2013 as well as the Israeli human rights group B\u2019Tselem \u2013 have described as  , though distinct from that seen in South Africa. Last year   in Israel and the West Bank and Jerusalem since the second intifada ended in 2005, with about 150 Palestinians and 30 Israelis killed, and another 49 Palestinians   on the Gaza Strip in August. Support for a two-state solution has   among both Palestinians and Israeli Jews, falling to its lowest level since polling began about two decades ago., By endangering western public support for the state of Israel, undermining its democracy and confounding its alliances, Netanyahu and his hate-mongering cronies show themselves to be their country\u2019s own worst enemies. Worse still, perhaps, Netanyahu\u2019s band of bigots is actively undermining Israel\u2019s democratic institutions and civil rights, such as peaceful protest and LGBTQ rights. The main reason is a new ultranationalist, hard-right religious coalition government in Jerusalem that includes racist, anti-Arab ministers determined to annex all the Palestinian territories., The plan announced by the justice minister, Yariv Levin, would allow even the slimmest Knesset majority to override supreme court decisions \u2013 which would mean that controversial new laws could be pushed through, targeting minorities, civil society and the right to protest against annexation. He has ordered police to tear down Palestinian flags, and the government is   by seizing Palestinian Authority funds in retaliation for it asking the international court of justice in The Hague for an advisory opinion on Israel\u2019s occupation of the West Bank. His extremist coalition partners were an expedient choice, given their desire to undermine the supreme court and scrap its rulings outlawing Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank., Yaakov Katz, editor-in-chief of the Jerusalem Post, has good reason to   Mr Ben-Gvir \u201cthe modern Israeli version of an American white supremacist and a European fascist\u201d. Mr Ben-Gvir plans a provocative ministerial \u201c \u201d to Haram al-Sharif, site of the third-holiest shrine in Islam, under the pretence that Israeli Jews are struggling for their religious rights. Days earlier, Mr Wennesland had been \u201c \u201d by the fatal shooting of an unarmed Palestinian man during a scuffle with an Israeli border police officer., In the subsequent years, with the formation of a Sudanese religious police in the early 90s, the spaces of relative freedom in which my mother had once dressed had closed up. In recent years, social media has created space for women to form positive communities. She was left a little lost for words as she tried to explain how the cultural and religious climate in Sudan had changed over the years., When I turned seven, they covered my head with the ugliest scarf in the world, which looked like a burlap sack, and sent me to school where, even though it was staffed solely by women, no one was allowed to remove the scarf. The deep wounds of the Yazidi and Iraqi women whose bodies became a battlefield and who were forced to  , the women of Afghanistan who ran away to   by their brothers and fathers to sex trafficking agents. From the first moments of the event, I felt gloomy as my family cast concerned looks at me while the press took pictures of my hair freely protruding from my scarf and clothes \u2013 a deliberate rebellion on my part against Iran\u2019s conservative traditions and beliefs., In other ages and cultures, much care and attention has been lavished on nit comb design: the V&amp;A museum has a 12th-century comb decorated with seven scenes from the Bible; an ornate 15th-century French comb was inscribed with the words \u201cfor your comfort\u201d. On a half-term visit to the Mary Rose Museum in Portsmouth\u2019s historic dockyard, amid the world\u2019s largest collection of Tudor artefacts, my sons and I admired the collection of 82 wooden nit combs dredged from the Solent in 1982 after four centuries embedded in the sea mud. The sentiment, and the design of the fine-toothed comb it was inscribed on, could not have been more relevant to my life; ever since schools reopened, I have been engaged, like many parents, in a seemingly never-ending battle against head lice., He lives in a settlement in Hebron known as Kiryat Arba, home to some of the most extreme Israeli settlers in the West Bank, and he has built a legal career defending Jewish Israeli extremists.  includes supporting full Israeli annexation of the West Bank and he has been at the forefront of supporting Israeli settler violence across Palestine. But a mere glance at the policy positions of his party,  ,  on the West Bank reveals what it means by a two-state solution: annexation of the settlement blocs that will result in cutting the West Bank in half, leaving only islands of Palestinian autonomy. Yet despite this prospect, for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza the Israeli elections have not been at the forefront of political discussion, as they continue to resist and fight for their survival on ever-shrinking territory., They mark the triumph of the racist far right, in the form of Mr Netanyahu\u2019s   allies, who want the deportation of \u201cdisloyal\u201d Palestinian citizens of Israel and the annexation of the occupied West Bank. Mr Netanyahu appears unfazed, doubtless counting on a Republican resurgence and Donald Trump\u2019s return in 2024, and the unlikelihood of Washington taking the kind of action that might make Likud think again in the meantime. Thanks to Mr Netanyahu, he now dominates the third-largest political force in Israel, and is expected to become a senior minister., In 2021, Mansour Abbas, an Israeli Arab, brought his Ra\u2019am party into the governing coalition led by Yair Lapid, the current centrist prime minister, and Naftali Bennett, his nationalist predecessor. Those who advocate boycotting the election see themselves as rejecting Israel\u2019s legitimacy, and that of local Arab-Israeli political leaders, a sentiment I heard as I spoke to students on the campus of Haifa university. He has also pledged to go easy in cases involving Israel\u2019s military and law enforcement, The convergence of Ben-Gvir\u2019s and Netanyahu\u2019s ambitions and intentions is overt., that Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, foreign minister of the UAE, conveyed his concern to Netanyahu about the leaders of the   party, Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich. With just days to go,   and the right lead in hypothetical match-ups, but may fall short of the 61 seats needed in the 120-member Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament, to dislodge Yair Lapid, the current prime minister. In the 2021 election, Israel\u2019s Arabs provided the votes needed to see Netanyahu thrown out of office, but 20 months later, that same constituency appears dispirited., As international law professor   pointed out: \u201cRecognising only West Jerusalem as the capital was still contrary to the international legal consensus \u2026 The Morrison government\u2019s position was also nonsensical, since Israel does not claim \u2018West\u2019 Jerusalem as its capital, but all of Jerusalem. It is time that Australia follows the international human rights community recognition of Israel as an apartheid regime and use its power to hold Israel accountable for its crimes against humanity, including, as   out, by \u201crescinding its objection to an international criminal court investigation into allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity\u201d. Recent reports by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the former and current United Nations special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian Territories, as well as Palestinian and Israeli NGOs conclude that Israel has put in place a system of racial domination, with an  Israeli apartheid, the UN Special Rapporteur on the oPt, Francesca Albanese, determined just a few days ago in her new report, \u201cis the hallmark of settler-colonialism, and a war crime under the Rome Statute\u201d., A few weeks after the start of the occupation in 1967, my father, Aziz Shehadeh, submitted   \u2013 for which he was able to get the support of 50 prominent Palestinian leaders from different parts of the occupied territories \u2013 for the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, according to the  , with its capital in the Arab section of Jerusalem. Likewise, any restraint on Israel in the form of opposition to this illegality from Britain, the EU and the US, has been entirely ineffective and restricted to formulaic statements, leaving Israel free to violate international law on building settlements in the occupied territories with total impunity. Then, last February, the Israeli attorney general moved to authorise the re-establishment of the evacuated Israeli settlement of  , on land that is privately owned by Palestinians, near Beita on Jabal Sabih., For young Iranian women, Amini\u2019s death ignited an explosion of pent-up fury at the regime\u2019s suppression of women\u2019s rights. These words have become the rallying cry for protest that has erupted in the wake of the murder of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini at the hands of Iran\u2019s feared morality police. Despite the regime shutting down the internet across the country, videos of police violence continue to leak out, further fuelling public rage., Considering the importance of such international forums in furthering British interests, at a time when the country has a stated goal of increasing its reach as \u201cglobal Britain\u201d, there were numerous files of great importance for the prime minister to focus upon. To move the embassy to Jerusalem would be to recognise Israel\u2019s invasion and occupation of east Jerusalem as legitimate. As such, for more than five decades, the annexation of East Jerusalem into a wider \u201cgreater Jerusalem\u201d, was rejected by all international institutions, even by Israel\u2019s allies internationally., The prime minister\u2019s remarks came on the sidelines of the UN general assembly meeting where Yair Lapid voiced support for a two-state solution \u2013 the first Israeli prime minister to do so since 2017. East Jerusalem has been considered occupied territory under international law since the six-day war in 1967, and the future capital of a Palestinian state. While it may have been intended to sweeten his message on Iran, most have seen it in the context of   \u2013 Israel\u2019s fifth in less than four years, and once again shaping up as a contest for and against former prime minister   (currently favoured by polls)., Despite western leaders\u2019 reluctance to get involved in Iranian women\u2019s struggle while entering more negotiations with Iran about a nuclear deal, some new developments, such as the US government\u2019s   on internet technologies, might be the beginning of the expansion of internet freedom in Iran. If George Floyd\u2019s killing highlighted the structural racism prevalent in US society, and   in Tunisia paved the way for the arrival of an unforeseen Arab spring across the region, Amini\u2019s death has led to the bursting open of 44 years of Iranian women\u2019s struggle against unjust laws and lack of control over their bodies and sexuality. The national information network makes it possible to divide Iranian cyberspace into two parallel universes: a national network and a global one \u2013 which, to the average user, look strikingly similar., If the embassy move went ahead, it would help to bury the notion, accepted even by past Israeli leaders such as Ehud Barak, Ehud Olmert and, before he reversed his position of less than 15 years ago, by Lapid himself, of a division of Jerusalem into two capitals, Israeli and Palestinian, side by side. The refusal to station an embassy in Jerusalem ahead of a just peace between   and the Palestinians is in keeping with international law and every UN resolution over five decades calling for an end to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. Beyond that, it would directly help to empower the Israeli right in their relentless extension of illegal settlements not only in East Jerusalem but across the West Bank, corralling and dispossessing Palestinians in the process., This grim sequence of events, while predictable, is both infuriating and distressing, primarily for Amini\u2019s family, but also for all those in Iran seeking to build an open society where human rights, and   in particular, are respected. Marchers at state-organised   demand the execution of \u201coffenders of the Qur\u2019an\u201d while Tehran\u2019s misnomered intelligence ministry slanders protesters as seditionists opposed to religious values. Notorious examples include the atrocious treatment meted out to the women\u2019s rights defender,  , use of torture and hostage-taking affecting dual nationals., The best way I can honour Abu Aqleh\u2019s memory is to ask you to consider this: if the violence that happened at a beloved Palestinian\u2019s funeral took place when the Israeli government knew the world was watching, what do you think happens to ordinary Palestinians the rest of the time? I am Palestinian (I used to say half-Palestinian, through my father, but now I refuse to slice myself in half) and have been told this several times. When my family moved to New York when I was a kid, for example, a person on our building\u2019s board heard my dad was Palestinian and \u201cjokingly\u201d told him not to hold any terrorist meetings in the apartment., Abu Aqleh\u2019s killing, likely by an Israeli sniper, the subsequent raid on her family home and the police\u2019s   prior to her funeral all point to the growing sense of impunity among Israel\u2019s decision-makers and military. The Israeli police\u2019s violent attempts to remove Palestinian flags hoisted during Abu Aqleh\u2019s funeral are merely the latest manifestation of a policy that aims to squash signs of Palestinian identity in Jersualem. Before Abu Aqleh\u2019s funeral, the Israeli police warned her family to avoid the event turning into a protest, a clear attempt to demonstrate Israeli dominance., According to the International Federation of Journalists, Israeli forces have killed   Palestinian journalists  , while Palestinian ministry of health data records 50 Palestinians killed in 2022  . This is why Shireen\u2019s killing during an Israeli raid on a refugee camp in Jenin shook all Palestinians to the core. What has made it all the worse is the Israeli propaganda machine, which swung into action as soon as news broke of Shireen\u2019s killing.","Large bases like Fort Liberty (formerly Fort Bragg) in North Carolina (160,640 acres), Fort Polk in Louisiana (198,000 acres), Fort Campbell in Kentucky (105,000 acres), and Fort Cavazos (formerly Fort Hood) in Texas, the largest U.S. base in the world (217,600 acres), are all options, among others.\u00a0  In the wake of the   of over 1,400 Israeli civilians, including innocent children and at least 33 American citizens, the risk Biden\u2019s irresponsible border policy presents to the domestic safety of American families is clear.\u00a0\u00a0    The former administration\u2019s \"Remain in Mexico\" policy required migrants seeking asylum to remain in Mexico until their claims were adjudicated., In recognition of the need to combat antisemitism in the U.S., Franciscan University recently partnered with The Philos Project, a community of Christians who seek to promote positive Christian engagement in the Near East, to cosponsor a joint conference, Nostra Aetate and the Future of Catholic-Jewish Relations at a Time of Rising Antisemitism. According to Dr. Hesemann, \"What has to be rewritten is the \u2018black legend\u2019 of the silent and disinterested Pope\u2026 Today, we know that Pius XII not only mentioned the horrible fate of the Jews in three public speeches but also tried to save as many as possible.\"    While a majority of voters agree that Israel must do what is necessary to destroy Hamas, and that Hamas is responsible for Palestinian civilian casualties, the outlandish defense of Hamas\u2019s atrocities across the United States\u2013 particularly on university campuses \u2013 raises great concern., \"\u00a0 Looking at higher education, he wrote, \"The great universities, the universities that educate a disproportionate share of the nation\u2019s future industrial, political and judicial leaders, struggle to explain the overall point of the education they offer. There has been an intentional project to deconstruct the Judeo-Christian worldview and Western civilization and replace it with the ideologies of neo-Marxist critical theory, including post-colonial theory, all the while refusing to take seriously radical Islamist claims (i.e., the intent to obliterate Israel by terror groups and governments like Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran). First, we need a move away from the radical skepticism promoted by the secular academy that says there is no such thing as truth or objective moral right and wrong.\u00a0 , The new Jacob had a new source of power: God. And of all the times to be given   name --   means \"God fights\" or \"God strives.\" His latest book is \" : What Jacob\u2019s Story Teaches Us About Grace, Mercy and God\u2019s Relentless Love\" (Thomas Nelson, September 12, 2023)., Death Valley experienced the highest midnight temperature ever recorded on Earth.\u00a0 Austin, San Antonio, Little Rock, Baton Rouge, Anaheim, Rapid City, Santa Fe, St. Paul, Corpus Christi, Sioux Falls, Fort Lauderdale, Reno, Helena, Grand Junction, Salt Lake City, San Juan, Tampa, Orlando, Fort Worth, Carson City, Portland \u2013 all of these cities experienced their highest temperatures on record. Dozens of locations in China experienced record-high temperatures last month, including the country\u2019s all-time temperature record of 126 degrees. Scientists look at a lot of things \u2013 gas trapped in ice, tree rings, glaciers, pollen remains, even changes in the Earth\u2019s orbit \u2013 to study the natural changes in our climate going back millions of years., Writing in the Jewish Journal, Kenneth L. Marcus, a former assistant U.S. secretary of Education for Civil Rights and an alumnus of U-C Berkeley Law School, notes: \"Berkeley law students are not the first to exclude Zionists. They include Women of Berkeley Law, Asian Pacific American Law Students Association, Middle Eastern and North African Law Students Association, Law Students of African Descent and the Queer Caucus.\u00a0 \u00a0  Isn't that the point of those who support critical race theory?\u00a0 \u00a0 Especially with America's history during World War II when the Roosevelt administration limited the number of Jews desperately fleeing Nazi Germany to enter this country, Berkeley and other students should be more welcoming to Jews, protect their free speech, and not silence them.\u00a0 , Mostly free of the pogroms that were a feature of Christian Europe, these communities were uprooted by a pincer of competing forces: Jewish nationalism in Israel and the Arab nationalisms of countries such as Iraq, trying to shake off the yoke of British imperialism. Protesters  , catastrophe and terror being inflicted on Palestinians in Gaza.   are accelerating globally, as   people have been killed in the sealed Gaza Strip, including over 4,000 children \u2013 and with thousands more injured or orphaned. It means we can view the Palestinian Nakba (catastrophe), the Holocaust and the exodus of Jews from Arab lands as a tangle of communities caught in the expanse of European colonialism and extreme racial thinking., What rightwingers term the new \u201caxis of evil\u201d \u2013 China, Russia and Iran \u2013 is turning the Gaza battle into an online world war, using state media and social networking platforms to boost Hamas and denigrate Israel and the US. What really interests Xi is how Israel\u2019s relentless assault on Gaza is making its US ally look weak and guilty by association in the eyes of the world while dividing the western democracies, alienating Arab states and discrediting the international rules-based order he hopes to replace. Sign up to  Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Xi says it is China\u2019s destiny to build \u201ca shared future for mankind\u201d., You\u2019ll hear a lot about that foundation myth today and how the human \u201closs\u201d and \u201csacrifice\u201d (331,000 Australians deployed; 60,000 killed; 155,000 wounded) was   seminal event upon which the new Australian federation was built, Australia having followed an empire into its first major war of too many to come. I fear that after the referendum campaign \u2013 whose more negative proponents boldly, falsely   colonialism was not detrimental to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people \u2013 an even greater inertia will befall, and more deliberate obstacles impede, the official memorialisation of Australia\u2019s true and complex war history. The Middle East and all of the dominoes that line up correspondingly behind Israel, and Arab, Muslim and other opponents of the Gaza invasion (for all the ongoing war\u2019s  ), compounds a global trauma already experienced over Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine., Given the desperate humanitarian situation in Gaza, given Israeli forces are closing in on the centre of Gaza City, given the death toll has now reached more than 10,000 people, including more than 4,000 children, given   have been a while coming \u2013 Australian Palestinian communities in Labor\u2019s electoral heartland are also in a state of acute despair. When Albanese went to thank members of the Islamic community for supporting the recognition of Australia\u2019s First Nations peoples, the prime minister said he had recently heard a teacher explaining why it was important for Muslims to be an ally for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Before Albanese departed for China last week, protesters in Melbourne were  : \u201cAlbanese blood on your hands\u201d, \u201cAlbanese can\u2019t hide, you\u2019re supporting genocide\u201d, \u201cAlbo, you coward, blood on your hands.\u201d, Rachel has undertaken a PhD on palliative care in Gaza and has been supporting the development of palliative care Dr Mhoira Leng is a Scottish palliative care physician with experience in clinical teaching and in supporting global health and palliative care development across Africa, India and in Gaza We are palliative care practitioners who were scheduled to be in Gaza this week to support palliative care education and mentoring of undergraduate medical students and postgraduate healthcare professionals. Palliative care is care \u2013 social, emotional, spiritual and physical \u2013 for a person and their family affected by serious illness and those at the end of their life, and bereavement care after somebody has died., Since 7 October, the day Hamas fighters inflicted carnage on a music festival and on kibbutzim inside Israel, all the main parties \u2013 the three making up the government, plus the Conservative CDU opposition and even the far-right AfD \u2013 have spoken with one voice, in solidarity with Israel. Sign up to  The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion The next phase of the conflict should require a new dynamic, a determined diplomacy involving Israel, the US and Arab states to help find a long-term political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian impasse. Even so, commentators on the right have accused the German government of going soft on these protests, while civil liberties groups have accused German police of censorship and heavy-handedness., And it will require Israel to stop establishing settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories \u2013 that even the divided UN security council agreed is a \u201cflagrant violation\u201d of international law and a \u201cmajor obstacle\u201d to peace.    So when Israel\u2019s friends urge Israel to exercise restraint and protect civilian lives, it is critical that Israel listens. Supporting civilians, helping prevent conflict from spreading, and reinforcing the need for a durable peace \u2013 all of which we pursue by working with countries that have influence in the region., And yet, I hesitate to see the value in admonishments during the current conflict towards those who have kept their counsel online \u2013 from celebrities such as Jewish actor Noah Schnapp, who   his feeds were \u201cchillingly quiet\u201d following Hamas\u2019s attacks on Israel, to Palestinian friends and internet strangers proclaiming that \u201cthe silence is deafening\u201d after Israel\u2019s bombardment of Gaza. If social media is the modern agora, then criticism of those not speaking out on important issues seems valid \u2013 especially if one is a public figure with a large social media following. His words, along with the Dietrich Bonhoeffer quote, \u201cSilence in the face of evil is itself evil\u201d, have spread on social platforms following the latest outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas., As the then Jamaican chief minister, Norman Manley, explained: \u201cThe ban on trade with South Africa is a logical and proper act done in respect of a country which denies to its own people all the basic human rights and denies to coloured people all over the world every right of human rights intercourse. \u201cThe ongoing harsh conditions under which the Palestinians live in veritable colonialism and Israel\u2019s sense of insecurity will contribute to a cycle of violence until those realities are definitively addressed,\u201d Caricom said. or Jamaicans, the  UN general assembly vote on a call for a \u201chumanitarian truce\u201d in the Israel-Hamas war was more than just an embarrassing political effort to \u201cwalk between raindrops\u201d, as one government critic put it., But as the war dragged on, European governments rose to the challenge And political unity in support of Ukraine has held despite setbacks, notably those created by Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Hungary.   on Russia, the hosting of millions of Ukrainian refugees, the victory over Moscow\u2019s attempt to weaponise Europe\u2019s energy dependence, and the sustained increase in military and economic assistance have been pillars of a concerted strategy. he outbreak of the worst violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for decades  triggered by Hamas\u2019 horrific attack on 7 October and Israel\u2019s disproportionate military response, marks a turning point in the unravelling of Europe\u2019s role in the world. Whereas some European leaders, such as Michel or the EU\u2019s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, have been clear in their messaging on Israel\u2019s legal obligations, others including Von der Leyen have been highly ambiguous,   within European institutions and beyond., So strong is the allegiance to their chosen side \u2013 their team \u2013 that at a home game on the afternoon of 7 October, hours after the men of Hamas had begun their massacre of civilians in southern Israel, and while the torture and murder of families in their homes was still under way, a group of Celtic fans  . It ends in a group of terrified Jewish students  of New York\u2019s Cooper Union college, fleeing a group of masked protesters chanting \u201cFree Palestine\u201d \u2013 their pursuers doubtless convinced they are warriors for justice and liberation, rather than the latest in a centuries-long line of mobs hounding Jews. Many millions around the world watch the Israel-Palestine conflict in the same way: as a binary contest in which you can root for only one team, and where any losses suffered by your opponent \u2013 your enemy \u2013 feel like a win., Unable to drive France   and into a \u201c \u201d with Russia and Venezuela, M\u00e9lenchon coaxed the rest of the French left into falling in line behind him in an   \u2013 the Nupes. But while M\u00e9lenchon may have attracted many young voters to his campaign, he is no Bernie Sanders: his refusal to evolve from cold war-era reflexive anti-Americanism and his desire to pursue a \u201crevolutionary\u201d brand of opposition have dragged the French left into unelectability and moral confusion. In the midst of the backlash, M\u00e9lenchon has doubled down, lashing out at Glucksmann for voting for a European parliament   condemning the 7 October attack, while at the same time completely ignoring LFI deputy  , who called Hamas a \u201c \u201d days after the details of the massacre had become widely available., The BBC is the issue because a strong, well-funded and editorially independent BBC has never been more important for an informed democracy than it is today. Our past calls in defence of the BBC\u2019s public broadcast legacy   by many, including David Attenborough, Lenny Henry, the late Hilary Mantel, and others who believe in the BBCs unique contribution to the cultural and social fabric of this country. We believe the BBC is the one British institution with the scale, global reach and editorial authority to create and protect this new and necessary, trusted digital public space., Not only have we been able to support organisations providing direct assistance to the communities impacted by this horrific and senseless violence but we are also funding our incredible grantee organisations paving the pathway for a shared future, grounded in justice, respect and collective responsibility, like the Tzedek Centres, a network of social justice centres led by Jews and Palestinian citizens of Israel. Sign up to  Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion As Jess Bricker of Standing Together, a grassroots organisation led by Jews and Palestinians, said at a briefing to our community last week: \u201cI think what we\u2019re seeing on social media is that people are being led to believe that they need to side with states and not with people \u2026 We need to build the front that is fighting for people. We have also seen the argument made that Palestinians support the attacks on Israelis because they voted for Hamas, although the elections where Hamas took power took place 17 years ago, when the majority of residents in Gaza were below voting age and, even then, less than 50% of Palestinians voted for Hamas., But the ban was also politically ill-conceived, as it came after a   in Paris in support of Hamas\u2019s Israeli victims, attended by thousands of legitimately grief-stricken people. France\u2019s Human Rights League, the government\u2019s ban on demonstrations in support of the Palestinian cause constitutes \u201ca serious and disproportionate attack on the right to demonstrate\u201d. Indeed, the sudden global focus on the Israel-Palestine conflict since the extreme violence of 7 October exposes another kind of violence: that of the silence about and invisibility of the daily oppression faced by Palestinian civilians., In the upheaval that is unfolding as the result, Enas is now one of countless displaced Palestinian residents of Gaza; having heeded Israel\u2019s warnings and moved from her Gaza City home to an uncertain future in the south. very Sunday since October 2021, Dr Enas, a passionate physician from Gaza City, has bid farewell to her two sons to embark on a journey to Wolfson hospital in Holon,  . Numerous Palestinian families in Gaza, especially those with critically ill children requiring specialised treatments such as chemotherapy and paediatric dialysis, are caught in this crossfire., The BBC\u2019s initial breaking news alert, simultaneously pinged to millions of phones via push notifications, said simply: \u201cHundreds feared dead or injured in Israeli airstrike on hospital in Gaza, Palestinian officials say\u201d, with a link to a more detailed report that many won\u2019t have clicked on. In the short time it took the Israeli government to check and then deny responsibility, blaming a misfiring rocket launched from within Gaza by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, the idea of Israeli guilt was halfway round the world. President Biden\u2019s summit with Arab leaders in Jordan was scrapped, Jewish communities around the world once again feared reprisal, and for several hours those closest to this conflict must have held their breath, wondering about potential repercussions for the Israeli hostages held captive in Gaza or Iran\u2019s appetite to escalate the conflict., Despite Israel\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, saying it will \u201c \u201d in Gaza and speaking of removing \u201crestraints\u201d on his troops, despite reported plans to raze entire cities to the ground and to drive out   from their homes, scores of British politicians repeatedly and bluntly refused to show concern for Palestinian civilian lives. The legislation blocking civil society attempts to pressure Israel  , the legislation undermining the right to protest and Suella Braverman\u2019s   prior to the weekend demonstrations are all attempts to prevent ordinary people of conscience from acting in solidarity with the oppressed, the occupied and the colonised. This erasure of the occupation is surprising because Israel\u2019s is the longest military occupation in modern history, and recently the UN general assembly asked the international court of justice  ., Unfortunately, many others are suffering a similar fate: many of the hostages taken have suffered grave injuries, including gunshot wounds and limb loss during the attack; others have cancer, Parkinson\u2019s disease and other serious medical conditions; several children have special needs; and at least one nine-month-old baby needs formula to stay alive, according to a medical report that a group representing the hostages\u2019 families presented to the International Red Cross, which is demanding access to the hostages. In a panic, Adva drove to Tamar\u2019s apartment, took her iPad and with the help of friends managed to trace her sister\u2019s phone \u2013 which hadn\u2019t moved from its location since 8.11am that morning. We know the UK government and others are supporting Israel, but we urge them to step up efforts to bring the hostages home to Israel \u2013 and at the very least make sure they are getting medical care they desperately need., My people are not weak, nor did they ever dismiss the ugliness of the injustices they endured; but even when enslaved people or persons claiming to care about the conditions of the enslaved used violence against innocent people, claiming it was for the cause of liberation, they said unequivocally: \u201cNo. We are not talking about slaves versus slave masters in Israel today, but I know from my own context that an unequivocal \u201cno\u201d to the actors within Hamas who chose to commit these heinous acts does not dismiss history and the oppression of Palestinian people when they have been beaten and harmed by the actions of some \u2013 not all \u2013 in Israel. Yes, the perpetrators of violence should face justice, just as some in Israel must be held accountable for its policies of violent apartheid against the Palestinian people (remember, many Israelis have and do oppose these policies, including some who were attacked last weekend)., Until last week, the Yom Kippur war, when Egypt and Syria launched an invasion from the south and north, was seen as the moment of Israel\u2019s maximum peril \u2013 but the despair, the dread, is even greater now, heightened yet further today when rocket sirens sounded across Israel\u2019s north. Given that, along with relentless airstrikes, Israel has already imposed a total siege on the strip, denying the 2 million Palestinians within food, fuel, electricity and water, it\u2019s no wonder the UN has   that such a mass movement of people will bring \u201cdevastating humanitarian consequences\u201d. But it was a pogrom that came to Israel last weekend, multiple pogroms in fact, as lethal as any that cut down the Yiddish-speaking Jews of the early last century or, in repeating patterns, the centuries before., In fact these callous displays are a gift to militant Zionism, since they neatly shore up and reconfirm its core and governing belief: that the non-Jewish world hates Jews and always will \u2013 look, even the bleeding-heart left is making excuses for our killers and thinks that Jewish kids and old ladies deserved death merely by living in Israel. Harder for us adults is the fact that, in their desire to celebrate the powerful symbolism of Palestinians escaping the open air prison that is Gaza \u2014 which occupied people have every right to do \u2014 some of our supposed comrades on the left continue to minimize massacres of Israeli civilians, and in some extreme cases, even seem to celebrate them. Her latest book Doppelganger: A Trip into the Mirror World was published in September This article was edited at the request of the author to reflect the fact that celebrations of the deaths were rare, and many leading figures on the anti-colonial left, in Palestine and outside of it, clearly denounced the targeting of civilians., The horrifying pogroms Azerbaijanis committed against the Armenians in our major cities were denied, minimised or explained away as being organised by the Armenians to make themselves look like victims, garner international sympathy and justify starting a war of occupation. Concentric circles of alternating ethnicities radiated outward from Shusha; Azerbaijanis surrounded by Armenians surrounded by Azerbaijanis and Azerbaijani Kurds and so on \u2013 a great inconvenience for emerging nationalist narratives. Before the first war, inside Azerbaijan\u2019s borders there existed the \u201cNagorno-Karabakh autonomous oblast\u201d, a majority-Armenian island, so to speak, of mountainous land, with the culturally significant, majority-Azerbaijani citadel   right in the middle., In July, the European Union   an agreement promising a substantial cheque to Tunisia\u2019s authoritarian leader, Kais Saied, in exchange for a crackdown on irregular migrants seeking to cross the Mediterranean to Italy. Nevertheless, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, flanked by Giorgia Meloni, Italy\u2019s radical-right prime minister, and Mark Rutte, the Netherlands\u2019 outgoing leader, have seen fit to employ him as a kind of border guard. In neighbouring Libya, where an EU-sponsored cooperation agreement was signed six years ago, detained migrants have been routinely   to rape, beatings, extortion and collective expulsion., Israel is giving a gift to its enemies in the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement and its allies, especially in South Africa, where denial of Israel\u2019s existence is intense among many black people, in trade unions and communist and Muslim circles. I write about South Africa and Israel because I know both of them, 53 years in one and nearly 26 years in the other. In Israel, the ultra-Orthodox have joined forces with Likud and religious nationalists to secure unlimited money for their separate schools, to keep their children out of the army and to impose their religious dictates on the entire country., While the Labor government is right to break away from previous governments, which failed to implement Australia\u2019s commitment to international law and the two-state solution, Labor has a chance to take a real and decisive step in upholding its values by voting to recognise the state of Palestine at its national conference this month. Given the urgency of the Israeli government and its unfolding extremist agenda Israel needs Australia and its allies to help protect the democratic vision of its founding fathers, as enshrined in Israel\u2019s 1948 declaration of independence. The Benjamin Netanyahu-led ultranationalist government is racing towards annexation of the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT), a manoeuvre which will not only end any chance of a two-state outcome, but also permanently entrench the daily humanitarian and anti-democratic nightmare that the Israeli occupation has become., Charles de Gaulle, France\u2019s most influential postwar president, summed up its importance by saying: \u201cFrench world power and French power in Africa were inextricably linked and mutually confirming.\u201d If \u2013 as seems likely \u2013 hatred of France intensifies, then there is every possibility of full-blown evacuations, to include French soldiers, as the key Fran\u00e7afrique nations of sub-Saharan Africa finally complete the decolonisation process. Troops working for Wagner, the Russian mercenary group, are meanwhile operating within Niger\u2019s neighbours, and have   to the rebellious Nigeriens.  were brandished by those demonstrating outside the French embassy in Niamey, with many calling for Vladimir Putin to replace Macron as their biggest global backer., But if the Australian government believes it has a duty to repatriate children born in Syria to Australian mothers then it equally has a right to at least offer that option to the children born in Syria to Australian fathers. Advocacy groups such as   have been vocal in calling for the repatriation of children born to Australian mothers, but silent on what to do with children born to Australian fathers. Children born to an Australian parent are, on the face of it, eligible for Australian citizenship as long as the child\u2019s parentage can be proven and one parent was an Australian citizen at the time the child was born., The hajj pilgrimage is, at its core, a pilgrimage towards God. We need to find it focused on a particular place and, for the Muslim, that place is the Ka\u2019ba at Mecca, which he has faced every time he prayed and to which he now journeys in pilgrimage. The Covid pandemic saw pilgrimage to the holy sites halted for two years, with only  permitted to perform the pilgrimage., From the EU\u2019s 2010  ; to its subsequent agreements with militias and warlords after western intervention had shattered Libya; to the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa set up in November 2015 as the Syrian war caused a sharp peak in migrants and panic in European capitals; to the Khartoum Process, which drew in countries in the east of Africa, including Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan and South Sudan; to bilateral deals with countries such as Turkey and Niger \u2013 the EU has disbursed billions of euros in an effort to persuade non-European countries to act as its immigration police. It is, in per capita terms, the largest recipient of EU aid, in return for which the Niger authorities are forced to distort domestic policies to fit with the EU\u2019s migration needs, including the adoption in 2015 of a law against smuggling migrants. The Brussels-enforced policy has not only acted as a block to Europe-bound migration but destroyed regional migration and made freedom of movement, that hallowed policy within the EU, much more difficult within Niger., Because imagining Tunisia without this or that side, Tunisia without Ennahdha, Tunisia without political Islam, without the Left, without any of its components, is a civil war project. Snaps of him standing alongside al-Assad and Egypt\u2019s Abdel Fatah al-Sisi during the summit were widely shared around the region, signalling Tunisia\u2019s return to the grand old club of Arab dictatorships. Since the era of the Arab spring, which in Tunisia saw Ben Ali deposed, the country has resisted the dark fates of its sisters such as Egypt, Yemen, Libya or Syria., The longer the war drags on, the greater the risk that more people will be drawn into this conflict: other domestic armed groups, civilians who begin to see no other way of defending their communities, and regional players pursuing their own interests. This speaks to the disregard shown to those caught up in the struggle between two generals: Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Sudan\u2019s army chief and de facto leader, and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as  , who commands the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. hen foreign diplomats fled   as fighting engulfed Khartoum, some denied Sudanese civilians the means to follow them to safety., Wars on Human Health, published by the Costs of War project at Brown University\u2019s Watson Institute, focuses on what she terms \u201cindirect deaths\u201d \u2013 caused not by outright violence but by consequent, ensuing economic collapse, loss of livelihoods, food insecurity, destruction of public health services, environmental contamination and continuing trauma, including mental health problems, domestic and sexual abuse and displacement. \u201cAbdoulaye is doubly uncounted: as a displaced person and as a war death,\u201d writes Stephanie Savell, a cultural anthropologist, recalling his brief life in a disturbing new report that reveals the vast, unacknowledged human costs of contemporary global warfare. Calculated this way, the total number of deaths that occurred as a result of post-9/11 warfare in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Libya and Somalia rises dramatically from an upper estimate of 937,000 to at least  , of which up to 3.6 million were \u201cindirect deaths\u201d., Many of our party were denied entry, including some British citizens \u2013 the British government again seemed to have made no effort to help its citizens get safe passage to Egypt despite its close ties with the country. I am a dual-national, British and Sudanese, and my husband and children are British citizens \u2013 so we contacted the embassy. The final straw for us came on Saturday 22 April when Dutch, French, Italian and Greek citizens \u2013 not diplomats \u2013 were informed they would be flown back home from an airstrip in Khartoum (this happened on the Sunday and Monday, as the Eid ceasefire was coming to an end)., Because imagining Tunisia without this or that side, Tunisia without Ennahdha, Tunisia without political Islam, without the Left, without any of its components, is a civil war project. Tunisia moved from Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali\u2019s autocratic rule to democracy with a thriving civil society and lively media, while others descended into anarchy, bloodshed and brutal repression. On Monday, scores of police  , leader of Ennahda who was elected speaker of the parliament, seizing on his remark that \u201cthere is a paralysis, intellectual and ideological, which, in reality, lays the ground for civil war., He said: \u201cA criminal plan has been set up since the beginning of this century to alter the demographic structure of   and certain parties received loads of money to enable the occupation of irregular sub-Saharan migrants in Tunisia.\u201d Tunisia became the first Arab country to ban slavery in the 19th century, but its legacy can still be seen in Arabic slurs that refer to black people as slaves. He claimed that \u201csuccessive waves of illegal immigration\u201d were part of a secret plot to dilute Tunisia\u2019s Arab-Islamic identity into \u201ca purely African country\u201d., China complained at the UN that   the nuclear non-proliferation treaty by transferring fissile material and nuclear technology to a non-nuclear weapons state. For his part, Xi can point to continuing US and UK nuclear weapons modernisation, and to last week\u2019s deal to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines. In other words, at the very moment when the Kremlin is under unprecedented pressure and US-Russia relations are at their most tense since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, the political channels, agreed mechanisms and binding limits that could help avoid a nuclear collision are less robust and dependable than ever before., He urged security forces to take urgent measures against migrants from sub-Saharan  , who he claimed were moving to the country and creating an \u201cunnatural\u201d situation as part of a criminal plan designed to \u201cchange the demographic makeup\u201d and turn Tunisia into \u201cjust another African country that doesn\u2019t belong to the Arab and Islamic nations any more\u201d. In Arab north Africa, racism towards black people is complicated even further by a paranoia of proximity \u2013 being situated on the African continent means there is an extreme sensitivity to being considered African at all, or God forbid, black. Racism towards black Arabs and black sub-Saharan Africans is entrenched in the Arab world \u2013 a legacy of slavery and a fetishised Arab ethnic supremacy., The money won\u2019t be lent to a dictatorial regime without support from civil society \u2013 notably Tunisia\u2019s powerful labour   \u2013 which Mr Saied has been repressing. Tunisia\u2019s president, Kais Saied,   the New York Times in 2021, quoting the words of the French statesman Charles de Gaulle. Mr Saied came to power because Tunisians had grown disillusioned with a political class that seemed unable to resolve the country\u2019s problems., Violence involving the Israeli army, Jewish settlers and Palestinians  Sign up to  Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Iran is near boiling point, too, owing to sweeping anti-government protests \u2013 and because nuclear talks with the west face imminent collapse.   The same factors that have induced South Korea and other regional countries to raise their game militarily, prompted the formation of  ( the Australia, UK and US security pact) and are feeding deeper cooperation within   (the US, India, Japan and Australia). Benny Gantz, Israel\u2019s outgoing defence minister, last week predicted further, bloody escalation in the occupied West Bank resulting from prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s decision   to his anti-Arab coalition partners., As we walked, he warned me that my colleagues at El Faro, the Salvadoran news organization, were being followed because of a story they were pursuing about negotiations between the president of   and the notorious MS-13 gang. So, represented by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, 14 of my colleagues at El Faro and I have decided to sue NSO Group. I was hacked while I pursued and published private videos of two brothers of President Nayib Bukele negotiating over El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin Law with foreign businessmen before it came into effect., Soon temperatures in the camps will reach near freezing, and I fear that if the remaining children are not rescued soon, we could see another death, as was seen earlier this year with the   of 17-year-old Australian boy Yusuf Zahab. Over the past year, I\u2019ve interviewed and surveyed family members, teachers, social workers, and mental health professionals about approximately 100 children repatriated from the camps who are now living in western Europe and central Asia. The squalid, locked camps where these children were detained still hold about 38,000 foreign nationals, mostly the wives and children of male IS suspects., In retrospect, it does seem that the whole idea of annual climate carnivals was probably not the best means of promoting serious action on global heating, but their hijacking by the fossil fuel sector, and failure, year on year, to do the job they were set up to do, surely means that Cop is no longer fit for purpose. The all-encompassing nature of the annual Cop climate conference provides one enormous open goal for fossil fuel representatives; an unprecedented opportunity to kettle ministers and heads of state from every corner of the planet, but particularly the  , to browbeat them into handing over their untouched fossil fuel reserves for exploitation. What is needed is an apparatus that is less cumbersome and more manageable \u2013 something leaner and meaner that zeros in on the most critical aspects of the climate crisis, that does its work largely hidden from the glare of the media, and which presents a less obvious honey pot to the busy bees of the fossil fuel sector., Horsham, West Sussex Of course children should have the strongest protections in the online safety bill, but scrapping the need to take action on legal but extremely harmful content would be a huge own goal for sites and undermines any suggestion of the UK being a safe place to go online (\u201c \u201d, News). It\u2019s worth remembering that Prof Ben Goldacre, commissioned by the government to review how the inherent value of NHS data can be extracted effectively and safely, admitted to a Commons inquiry that he\u2019d opted out of a previous plan to mine patients\u2019 data. The lack of public consultation about a federated data platform is shameful, not least because of the claim that patients\u2019 privacy will be protected due to the data being \u201cde-identified\u201d or pseudonymised., Without getting into crude national stereotyping, as I recall it, whenever there was a long, artful slow-motion replay of the wrong thing at the wrong time, the finger of blame \u2013 unfairly perhaps \u2013 would generally point at whichever French match director happened to be in charge that day. For a start, there\u2019s the ever-increasing number of camera shots to choose from, with cameras all around the ground \u2013 at the side of the pitch, high up, behind the goals, or offering a bird\u2019s eye view from above \u2013 while others follow a single player, or are trained on each of the coaches. And neither does the director want to have us admiring a lovingly curated slow-motion reprise of a fine save at one end of the pitch, while someone is putting it in the net at the other end., The Iranian women\u2019s revolution has tapped into a collective struggle for women across the globe as we continue to face issues of equality and fairness, such as a continued lack of representation in all levels of government and business; the gender pay gap; and most concerning, the continued erosion of women\u2019s rights in places such as Afghanistan, India and even the US. As members of the UN Commission on the Status of Women, with a strong international standing and a large Iranian diaspora, our response needs to be commensurate with our commitment to protect the universality of human rights and the promotion and progress of social inclusion by ensuring equal rights for women and young girls. Action by the Australian government will send a clear message not only to the Iranian regime, that we are watching and questioning their legitimacy to govern Iran, but also to all migrants who lovingly call Australia home, that they matter and that our government will not remain a spectator while humans suffer., What started as a mass uprising condemning the killing under police custody of 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian Mahsa Amini for a dress code violation has now amalgamated into widespread calls for a complete regime change in Tehran. The Australian government has joined others, including Germany, the UK, US, Canada, Austria and Spain in condemning the Iranian regime for its treatment of protesters. These protests are historically unique for Iran: this is the  , with Iranian men standing shoulder to shoulder with valiant Iranian women., The fact remains that FCDO diplomacy and humanitarian operations in places such as Afghanistan and Ukraine, UK international aid and development assistance, and the BBC\u2019s global journalism \u2013 vital soft power tools \u2013 are all struggling with financial cuts. Any such rethink should be expanded to include the   to Britain\u2019s foreign aid budget forced through by Boris Johnson and the ongoing freeze on \u201c \u201d international aid imposed when Liz Truss was foreign secretary. The decision formed part of a wider package of planned BBC World Service cuts that will also end radio broadcasts in leading languages such as Chinese, Arabic, Hindi and Indonesian., he prime minister\u2019s hour-long personal demolition derby on   on Thursday was rightly taken as an occasion to celebrate the skills of local BBC breakfast presenters, who did a fine job of holding her to account and exposing the horrible yawning vacancies of her position. Watching the incredible courage of women cutting their hair and burning their hijabs on Iran\u2019s streets this past week   in custody of Mahsa Amini reminded me of those feather dusters; perhaps, finally, their days are numbered.   There was a kind of comedy in this at the time \u2013 the Ken Dodd feathers were employed, we were told, to indicate that this was \u201clight touch\u201d enforcement \u2013 but the spectacle was nonetheless a chilling reminder of how choices for Iranian women were ultimately so rigidly circumscribed., His years-long quest to change his country\u2019s moniker to T\u00fcrkiye (pronounced Tur-key-yay) reached a   last week when the UN gave its official blessing. \u201cT\u00fcrkiye is the best representation and expression of the Turkish people\u2019s culture, civilisation and values,\u201d Erdo\u011fan declared. But   formally became the Republic of T\u00fcrkiye (T\u00fcrkiye Cumhuriyeti) after independence in 1923, following the abolition of the Ottoman sultanate.","Hamas\u2019s war aim (unstated, and therefore speculative) is presumably to provoke Israel to commit such barbarities in response to its terrorist attack that it loses international support and becomes, ultimately, forced to make major concessions to the Palestinians in the form of a genuinely autonomous state. This exacerbates the polarisation, and calls into question whether a two-state solution is still a viable endpoint, or whether only a one-state solution, with Israelis and Palestinians full and equal citizens in a single state, would create the necessary pressures to moderation to bring lasting peace in the region. Both common humanity, given the level of suffering, and the need to retain international backing, should persuade Israel to allow humanitarian aid \u2013 food, water, medicines \u2013 to reach the people of Gaza as swiftly as possible, a case urged by both   and  ., These proxy wars, by the US in Ukraine and Russia in Syria, become more intractable when those allies have nothing but money to lose in fighting on, and status to lose in backing off. Sooner or later someone has to chart a route out of hell, when fighting on the ground has reached a stalemate and when the internal politics of the contending parties renders bilateral talks unthinkable. The host must be impartial in pushing the most difficult task of mediation, making the pain of compromise preferable to that of war., The sportswashing efforts of various Middle Eastern regimes \u2013 the Qatar World Cup, grands prix in Bahrain,   and, most visibly, the takeovers of football clubs by various sovereign wealth funds \u2013 have been pored over and criticised, but pop\u2019s involvement in cultural reputation-laundering has been largely ignored. Pop still likes to think of itself as countercultural (despite decades of evidence to the contrary, such as numerous corporate tie-ins), so it tends to align with causes perceived as being leftwing \u2013 and there\u2019s no firmer signifier of your leftwingness than wanting to boycott Israel in support of Palestine. Or take the 1975, a band I think are great,   only to play festival bills with a gender-balanced lineup, yet still last year  , a festival   for the maleness of its lineups., The Saudi sovereign wealth fund PIF has essentially bought professional golf, taking over the PGA Tour by merging it with LIV, a new, smaller competition golf series that Saudi Arabia launched in 2021. These are justified concerns: Saudi Arabia\u2019s image problem has intensified under its leader, Mohammed bin Salman, who brought the nation into global disrepute with the grisly murder of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a crackdown on political opposition and the ramping up of capital punishment. On the campaign trail in 2019, Joe Biden   that Saudi Arabia would be punished for its murder of Khashoggi, and for the brutal war in Yemen, pledging to end the sale of materiel to the Saudis \u201cwhere they\u2019re going in and murdering children\u201d., Unlike in my youth, when they meant discovering players from different lands, today\u2019s World Cups are essentially contests between players from European clubs who know each other well and often play for the same team. The other is of the  , Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, putting the traditional Arab men\u2019s cloak, the black  , round Messi, just before he receives the trophy. These self-appointed guardians of the game, who for decades have feasted on venality, continue to make promises they know they cannot fulfil, and instead use the wonders of Messi and others to validate themselves., At university, I sat in the press box at Lincoln City covering matches, and eventually found myself working on one of the longest-running and most successful football video games \u2013 one I\u2019d played religiously from my early teens. With my colleagues, I felt a bit embarrassed to admit what I was doing, given so much of what we do revolves around following top-level football. I\u2019m sure the BBC and ITV won\u2019t miss one viewer, and Fifa have already made millions selling TV rights for the North American World Cup in 2026., The EU was \u201ca huge global player, and of course, everything from tech companies to states outside the EU is going to try to influence it,\u201d she said. Their detention followed Belgian police raids that turned up \u20ac1.5m in cash, allegedly to be used for advancing EU visa liberalisation and aviation deals favourable to Qatar. Schinas represented the EU at the opening ceremony of the men\u2019s football World Cup in Qatar.   , There is still time to make some partial amends for the mistake made in 2010 when \u2013 after a   bidding process \u2013 Fifa awarded the World Cup to a super-rich oil state with a   human rights record and draconian anti-gay laws. He stands within touching distance of a World Cup winners\u2019 medal to complete arguably the greatest career in football history. The first African and Arab team to reach a World Cup semi-final were both a revelation and a source of continental and cultural  ., A historical perspective shows us, ironically, that the concept of universalism, far from being merely a European outlook, was developed and enlarged through struggles against European rule, while many of the ideas of cultural relativism find their roots in European Romanticism. While many of those who stood in the Enlightenment tradition and declared that \u201call men are created equal\u201d were willing to endorse slavery and colonialism, it was through the struggles of enslaved people, of colonial subjects, of working-class people, and of women, to emancipate themselves that the ideas of equality and universalism were given a fuller meaning. The American Christian conservative Rod Dreher, a cheerleader for Donald Trump, Marine Le Pen and Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has condemned western \u201ccultural imperialism\u201d towards Qatar,   \u201cthe disgusting arrogance of western liberals who treat the diverse peoples of the world as if they are wogs who exist to be humiliated into being civilised\u201d., Whenever I see people arguing hour after hour about their supposed causes on social media, I no longer even think of them as working in the service of those causes, but simply in the (perhaps unwitting) service of whichever Silicon Valley billionaire owns the digital space where they\u2019re doing it. Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist Join John Crace, Marina Hyde and Armando Iannucci for a look back at another chaotic year in Westminster, live at Kings Place in London, or via livestream. So anodyne is the wider armband advocacy movement that it seems concerned above all else with not causing offence, to the point where it is impossible to imagine it sitting even very distantly on a continuum with sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos\u2019s   at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics (and the solidarity of the silver medallist,  ), or  \u2019s heroic career self-harm., The Conservative MP David Mundell, the first openly gay Tory cabinet minister, accepted hospitality worth \u00a37,473 from Qatar, and then, in a parliamentary debate a few months later, in response to concern raised by another MP about LGBTQ+ rights in Qatar, said that Qatar\u2019s critics should \u201cfocus their energies on the handling of LGBT issues in professional football in the UK\u201d. Qatar and other wealthy undemocratic regimes around the world are empowered in Britain, and by extension on the global stage, by a parliamentary system open to lobbying, a lucrative weapons industry, and a real-estate economy that is geared to a global wealthy elite. In the runup to the World Cup, the value of Qatar\u2019s gifts to British MPs was   than the amount spent by all the other 15 countries whose governments made donations to British MPs combined., As the England team flew into Qatar in a jet that advertised its  , Gianni Infantino, the president of Fifa, was in Bali   at the G20 summit that the World Cup could be used to stop the Russian devastation of Ukraine. On Blatter\u2019s watch, during the four decades when he was first Fifa general secretary and then president, multiple World Cup votes became the subject of corruption allegations. The difference with Qatar is that, while England failed dismally in its courtship of Fifa, eliminated on both bids with only two votes, Qatar succeeded., If the beautiful game is truly the world game, then Fifa should expect players and fans to be vocal in equal parts about the goals that get scored and issues that impact people across the globe. In a sliding doors moment, when Fifa awarded Qatar with the rights to host the 2022 World Cup, Australia also had a bid in contention. Fifa hasn\u2019t helped with the backlash, telling players to \u201cfocus on football\u201d implying that players are built to kick a ball without consequence or context., And with its al-Udeid airbase playing host to the forward headquarters of the US military\u2019s Central Command, Qatar sits right at the heart of western power projection into the Gulf, as it has done for more than 100 years. Even after the Gulf states gained independence in the 1960s and 70s, scores of British civilians remained in their militaries and state bureaucracies, including in Qatar\u2019s, to ensure the regimes\u2019 survival and their correct geopolitical orientation. It was British imperial power that first integrated the Gulf states of Kuwait, Bahrain,  , the UAE and Oman into the structures of the global economy with discoveries of vast oil and gas reserves sealing the region\u2019s status as a major material and geostrategic prize., But the  , which kicks off next Sunday, so far seems to have done more to stain the image of football than improve Qatar\u2019s.   as well as human rights campaigners have complained that this looks more like a grubby hymn to money and power than a joyous celebration of the game \u2013 even if the drama and tension of the tournament will end up overwhelming many people\u2019s qualms. Last week, a Qatar World Cup ambassador   homosexuality as \u201cdamage in the mind\u201d and Sepp Blatter, the former head of Fifa,   Qatar was a bad choice as host (though only because it was \u201ctoo small a country\u201d). Regimes seeking kudos have gained the assistance of sports stars \u2013 from David Beckham to Pep Guardiola \u2013 and international institutions who employ high-flown rhetoric about athletic excellence and global friendship while trousering large sums., Iran\u2019s players are uncomfortably aware of regime efforts to use football (and them) to present a normal face to the world and distract attention from the crisis at home. The Saudi regime has turned Qatar-style sportwashing \u2013 reputation laundering \u2013 into a successful industry through lavish sponsorship of international sporting events and the purchase of the English Premier League club Newcastle United. Now, pressed into action by this murderous regime, Iran\u2019s   is about to play England, Wales and the US in the 2022 World Cup \u2013 as if nothing untoward were happening., At the 1934 World Cup, in Italy, Mussolini\u2019s blackshirts explicitly used the Italian national team to build support for fascism, winning their home tournament, and winning again in France four years later, the first team to win an away World Cup. In Qatar, homosexuality is illegal and   by Qatar World Cup ambassador Khalid Salman as \u201cdamage in the mind\u201d. The winners of football\u2019s World Cup are a likewise select few from Europe and South America, but the teams that make it to the semi- and quarter-finals come from every continent, every corner of the world., The 2008 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics in China; the 2014 Winter Olympics in Russia; the Bahrain Grand Prix; the 2019   in Qatar; the 2019 Anthony Joshua  : there is an indisputable trend of big sporting events being hosted by rich but unsavoury countries. There is the push factor of dictatorships around the world seeking to launder their reputations through the medium of international sport \u2013 $200bn on a World Cup doesn\u2019t just secure international visitors and sporting entertainment but PR that money normally can\u2019t buy. This World Cup is just the latest in a long line of expensive international sporting events that have been hosted by nations that stand accused of fundamental human rights breaches., The most appropriate and effective way of recognising some of the errors in awarding the football World Cup to Qatar ( ) would be to encourage players to lower their heads for a short period after the national anthems. Re the use of \u201cold age\u201d as a cause of death on the certificate ( ), I am 98 years old and when I die I hope that it will say: \u201cHeart termination.\u201d   Quite rightly, an emphasis has been placed on Covid deaths, but is it not about time we also had an inquiry into the excess deaths caused by successive Conservative governments ( )?  , Migrant workers at the Al Bayt stadium, where England will play the USA on 25 November, had been obliged to pay huge illegal recruitment fees and lived for months in unfit, overcrowded accommodation, earning \u00a31 an hour. A recent YouGov  , commissioned by Amnesty International, found huge support for a compensation fund for migrant workers who have been mistreated, and for the relatives of those who died. After prolonged hesitation, the English FA has now   the principle of a fund, as have high-profile figures in football such as the Dutch national team manager, Louis van Gaal, and the Brazil coach, Tite., This week I was filming interviews with Nepali workers who had been sent home from Qatar recently, as companies wrap up construction projects on the eve of the  . A day of manual labour in Nepal can earn as little as 400 rupees (\u00a32.75), and so even Qatar\u2019s paltry minimum wage, equivalent to about \u00a38 a day, appears attractive. Under Qatari employment law, foreign workers have the right to change jobs if their contract is terminated and legal procedures are in place if an employee does not receive their wages or allowances at the end of their contract., Britain\u2019s two largest unions, Unite and Unison, have joined Amnesty and Human Rights Watch to   Gareth Southgate\u2019s England team to publicly back two proposals to boost migrant workers\u2019 rights in Qatar. The Guardian has reported since   on the need for action to protect migrant workers supplying the labour that fuels the ambitious \u201cnation-building\u201d programmes of Qatar and its neighbouring states.

On Friday, hundreds of UCLA faculty members\u00a0called on the administration to \"denounce\u00a0in the strongest possible terms any celebrations of Hamas terror attacks and killings,\" and asked the university to hold those \"who directly participate in such incitement\" accountable, using existing rules against incitement to violence. The actions bars them from taking university funds or operating on campus for at least five weeks, though the action will continue if the groups don\u2019t stop breaking school rules, using violent rhetoric and intimidating Jewish students., For instance, Beijing looks to already have signed off on the two key asks from the : nuclear arms-control talks and reestablishment of military-to-military contacts, where the senior leaders of the armed forces of both sides are permitted routine consultations. Hudson Institute senior fellow Rebeccah Heinrichs joins 'FOX &amp; Friends' to discuss President Biden's expected meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Xi gets some rhetorical breathing space that spares him making hard concessions \u2013 like not sending military aid to Russia, cheating on sanctions, or cheerleading for Hamas and Iran.   , These numbers, which would make our elected officials green with envy, suggest that even a year after the passing of the beloved Queen Elizabeth II, King Charles is doing his part to guarantee the monarchy remains a key pillar of British life.\u00a0  Having conducted diplomatic tours to France and Germany, the king and queen deployed the charms of skilled non-political heads of state in smoothing over diplomatic grudges with important trading partners while celebrating shared interests and values.\u00a0  While protesters filled London and New York streets calling for annihilation of Israel and death to the Jews, the British Royal Family were quick to condemn the atrocities and meet with Jewish leaders to reassure Britain\u2019s Jews that their safety and well-being is a chief priority for the nation. \u00a0   , If indeed the president and his family took in millions of dollars from government-affiliated entities in China, as it appears they did, we can be certain the details of those transactions are known to Xi and can be used to \"persuade\" Biden to adopt the party line --- the Communist Party line, that is. Rather than hammer China\u2019s president over his financing of  , his lies about the Wuhan virus, or the planned spy base in Cuba, Biden will stick to safe turf, like begging Xi to expand his country\u2019s commitment to climate change. At the least, Biden will most likely avoid challenging Xi on the critical role Beijing plays in poisoning tens of thousands of Americans each year with fentanyl or their support for Iran-backed Hamas., On the eve of what was projected to be a seismic   brokered by the United States, thousands of Hamas terrorists burst out of Gaza and engaged in a vicious rampage of rape, torture and murder against Jews in southern Israel, creating a regional crisis so severe that conventional wisdom now holds that any deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia is impossible. Given Iran\u2019s well-documented intention to eradicate Israel, the regime has good reason to want to disrupt an Israel-Saudi deal that would build on the   and solidify relations between the Jewish state and Iran\u2019s leading regional competitor.\u00a0    Recent Chinese inroads in Middle East diplomacy, notably the\u00a0Iran-Saudi deal on Yemen\u00a0brokered in Beijing last March, could be derailed, all of which gives China, as well as Iran, a vested interest in disrupting such a deal., A new AP poll found 58% of adults worry that AI, \"will increase the spread of false and misleading information during next year's elections,\" AP explained.\u00a0  The lost Beatles song \"Now and Then\" features an official music video that blends new video of the remaining members of the band with old clips, at times difficult to tell apart. Famous women, who are already subject to online harassment, will now face countless examples of fan-created deepfakes depicting them in false ways \u2013 first in photos and then in realistic audio and video.   , A non-Jewish friend sent me a piece about Jewish billionaire Henry Sweica's resignation from the Columbia University board over concerns that the university allowed pro-Hamas protesters to engage in hate speech on campus. Few people I know don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem when Israel uses a 2,000-pound bomb to kill a single Hamas leader that also kills 99 innocents. But it\u2019s Israel that is supposed to figure this all out and apparently the only way to figure it out is to pause or cease or stop pursuing those responsible because they are sacrificing their own people who they\u2019ve never fought to protect., Iran\u2019s military options are limited, the  , and behind the scenes, a lot of governments in the region want to contain Iran. Iran\u2019s President Ibrahim Raisi complained China does not do enough for Iran during a Beijing visit earlier this year.\u00a0   China buys 58% of Iran\u2019s oil, skirting sanctions and keeping Iran in business., There was no discussion of China\u2019s repression and human rights abuses against millions of Uyghurs, rampant intellectual property theft, complicity in the fentanyl epidemic that kills tens of thousands of Americans each year, threats toward democratic Taiwan, or economic coercion exerted through its Belt and Road Initiative.\u00a0\u00a0 Time and time again, the Biden administration is more than willing to look the other way for short-term policy concessions at the expense of the American people. Despite occasional stern rhetoric, the Biden administration\u2019s actions toward China are nothing short of appeasement.   recently wrapped up a summit with his Chinese Communist Party (CCP) counterpart in the Coachella Valley to hold private conversations on how the United States and China can partner to combat climate change. \u00a0  In other words, the Biden administration will continue to pursue harmful energy regulations that curb its fossil fuel production and increase prices for everyday Americans while simultaneously allowing China to approve an average of two new coal plants per week., Pro-Palestine demonstrators disrupted a House Judiciary hearing on addressing the rise of antisemitism and anti-conservative bias on college campuses, chanting \"Free Gaza,\" \"cease-fire now\" and other demands before being escorted out by police. According to many others, including Hamas, it is a call to destroy Israel  \u00a0 Even after being censured by the House of Representatives for her antisemitic remarks and for spreading Hamas propaganda, with   Tlaib doubled down, saying she would not be silenced and that her words were being distorted.\u00a0  But until that happens, until our society utterly rejects the double standards of identity politics, a lot of Jews are going to take a lot of abuse, and silence in the face of that abuse is indeed complicity.\u00a0 , The school, renovated and funded by the PA, stands as a lasting monument to terrorism, sending a clear and harmful message to the young students who attend.  of the PA, is a notorious Holocaust denier, a fact that is well-documented and beyond dispute. The naming of a school in Hebron after Mughir Al-Khdeir, a Hamas operative involved in the kidnapping and murder of an Israeli border policeman, is a glaring example of the PA\u2019s endorsement of violence. By financially rewarding terrorists and their families, the PA is essentially underwriting terror, fueling a cycle of violence that precludes any possibility of peace.\u00a0 , So no matter how bad things are now, rejoice that Hillary will always be the biggest loser and just as Bill said, he did not have sexual relations with that woman, we can be grateful we never had President Hillary screwing over the whole country. 'Gutfeld!' panelists reach to Hillary Clinton comparing former President Donald Trump to Hitler on 'The View.' Sunny Hostin, the only member of \"The View\" not vaccinated for canine distemper, kicked things off by asking Hillary what will happen if Trump is reelected., Multiple fights occur on Wednesday night near the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles following the screening of footage depicting the Hamas attack on Israel. This kind of inanity is exactly why Gal Gadot is screening this footage \u2014 footage \u00a0Hamas themselves filmed \u2014 and it\u2019s why terrorist sympathizers are angry with her for doing so. Writing in the National Post, Jesse Kline, who watched the screening in Canada, remarked, \"After witnessing these horrors, it\u2019s hard to disagree with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s characterization of this as a \u2018battle between civilization and barbarism.\u2019, To pursue the misguided course of isolationism and end support to allies like Israel, Ukraine, and others, would be yet another sign of weakness at a time when forces of evil like China, Russia, and Iran already smell blood.\u00a0    Level with the American people, articulate a clear strategy for forcing Putin to the negotiating table on terms most favorable to Ukraine, and commit to transparent accountability measures so that the American people can trust that their hard-earned tax dollars are not being wasted. That means providing lethal aid to Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan enabled by direct investment in American manufacturing and that will simultaneously result in a more modern U.S. military., Where does that leave U.S. policy as the Hamas-UNRWA propaganda machine provides cover for military assets and educates children to commit genocide while accusing Israel of war crimes?\u00a0 \u00a0resumed\u00a0funding UNRWA after President Trump cut it in 2018. In Gaza, UNRWA subsidizes Hamas by delivering basic services instead of the government \u2013 enabling Hamas to spend more money on terrorism instead.\u00a0 UNRWA staff, contractors and beneficiaries\u00a0are, by design, not subject\u00a0to U.S. counterterrorism vetting \u2013 because to conduct such vetting would reveal the extent to which U.N. money flows into Hamas coffers.\u00a0 , For even 22 Democrats to leave statements blaming Israel in America for the 10/07 attacks while calling the Hamas massacre resistance were simply too much. 'Gutfeld!' panelists weigh in on Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., being censured by the House of Representatives for anti-Israel rhetoric. I bet   is so glad she divorced him, but if they build those asylums, they better build them big, because tens of thousands of college kids now believe antisemitism is something you get extra credit for., While he predicted that Hamas would win its \"blessed battle\" with Israel and praised the rocket attacks on Israel and U.S. bases in the region by other Iranian-affiliated militant groups in Iraq and Yemen, Nasrallah did not say that Hezbollah and the Iranian-led \"axis of resistance\" would immediately do more to help Hamas. Both calculations might still prove valid if Palestinian deaths and suffering in Gaza continue to command the world\u2019s attention and spark increasing outrage, but Hamas\u2019s hope that Iran and Hezbollah, which has de facto control of Lebanon, would escalate the conflict to defend Hamas and the Palestinians of Gaza seems to be misplaced. If Hamas was distressed by Hezbollah\u2019s apparent reluctance to offer greater military aid, it must also have been disappointed by Washington\u2019s continuing support for Israel\u2019s right to bomb Hamas strongholds despite soaring Palestinian civilian deaths and a looming humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza., When student organizations endorsed Hamas\u2019 murderous rampage, when   needed multiple statements in order to make clear that she wasn\u2019t indifferent to this act of terrorism, when Gay told Jewish students at a\u00a0shabbat service that \"Harvard has your back\" only to remain mute when a viral video showed a Jewish student being bullied by pro-Hamas protesters on Harvard\u2019s campus... More than two decades ago, Harvard philosopher Harvey\u00a0Mansfield developed the practice of issuing students two sets of grades: One that reflected an honest assessment of their performance and another designed to mesh with \"Harvard\u2019s inflated grades.\" An\u00a0analysis\u00a0of 160,000 Harvard admissions files found that Asian American applicants outscored every other racial group on metrics like test scores, grades and extracurriculars but were kneecapped by Harvard staff consistently giving them dismal ratings on subjective traits like personality and kindness.\u00a0 , As Cultural Marxism took over, many students\u2014unburdened by the need to work or seek life\u2019s basic necessities like food, water, or shelter, and from the comfort of a taxpayer-subsidized dorm room\u2014have become completely dedicated to cooking up grand Marxist schemes. Unwoke outlines the scope of our problem with the radical left and how its radical ideology is trickling down from universities to boardrooms, the government, Hollywood, and even K-12 schools. Even more people need to stand up and confront this vile rhetoric, defeat the toxic woke ideology indoctrinating students on college campuses, and ensure that our country resembles the one we grew up in., I grew up part of an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in Jerusalem, attending ultra-Orthodox Jewish schools. My former community drilled into us an important lesson: no matter what the whole world thinks, no matter what people around us say, we have to be upright and strong and do the right thing, even when it\u2019s not popular.\u00a0    My former community drilled into us an important lesson: no matter what the whole world thinks, no matter what people around us say, we have to be upright and strong and do the right thing, even when it\u2019s not popular.\u00a0 , In the embrace of the deterministic view of the world that afforded enormous progress \u2013 think about the state of technology today and the prosperity it made possible \u2013 the world continues to accumulate every imaginable means for reacting. The result: mass demonstrations, in European countries, in Australia, and in New Zealand,   Only a holistic view of the events can help understand the way the world has changed in the woke recent years, and why universities became the stomping grounds for indoctrination.\u00a0  Rep. Ami Bera, D-Calif., joined \u2018Fox News Live\u2019 to discuss the Israel-Hamas war as Biden calls for a humanitarian pause in the conflict.\u00a0 , In recognition of the need to combat antisemitism in the U.S., Franciscan University recently partnered with The Philos Project, a community of Christians who seek to promote positive Christian engagement in the Near East, to cosponsor a joint conference, Nostra Aetate and the Future of Catholic-Jewish Relations at a Time of Rising Antisemitism. According to Dr. Hesemann, \"What has to be rewritten is the \u2018black legend\u2019 of the silent and disinterested Pope\u2026 Today, we know that Pius XII not only mentioned the horrible fate of the Jews in three public speeches but also tried to save as many as possible.\"    While a majority of voters agree that Israel must do what is necessary to destroy Hamas, and that Hamas is responsible for Palestinian civilian casualties, the outlandish defense of Hamas\u2019s atrocities across the United States\u2013 particularly on university campuses \u2013 raises great concern., \"\u00a0 Looking at higher education, he wrote, \"The great universities, the universities that educate a disproportionate share of the nation\u2019s future industrial, political and judicial leaders, struggle to explain the overall point of the education they offer. There has been an intentional project to deconstruct the Judeo-Christian worldview and Western civilization and replace it with the ideologies of neo-Marxist critical theory, including post-colonial theory, all the while refusing to take seriously radical Islamist claims (i.e., the intent to obliterate Israel by terror groups and governments like Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran). First, we need a move away from the radical skepticism promoted by the secular academy that says there is no such thing as truth or objective moral right and wrong.\u00a0 , The people of Gaza, after voting for Hamas, live within a terror war machine and sadly, we must recognize that they continue to support Hamas and its atrocities.\u00a0\u00a0  In an audio clip released by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on social media, an IDF soldier urges a Gaza resident to head south, but the resident, identified as Muhammad, claims Hamas is forcing everyone to stay north. The immoral and false comparisons between Israel, a law-abiding democracy, and Hamas, an internationally designated terror group, that we are seeing at the UN and in the media now is exactly what the terrorists want.\u00a0 , Those who incite violence or endorse terrorist activity by supporting Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and attacks against Jews are in violation of the terms of their visas and should no longer be welcomed as guests of America. The Immigration and Nationality Act prohibits entry of anyone who \"endorses or espouses terrorist activity or persuades others to endorse or espouse terrorist activity or support a terrorist organization.\" That includes people who defend or support Hamas by calling for intifada, jihad, or other similar actions to eliminate the Jewish state of Israel.\u00a0 , While serving as then-President Barack Obama\u2019s secretary of Treasury, Lew championed the Iran nuclear deal and was instrumental in its implementation.   which delivered over $100 billion in sanctions relief to Israel\u2019s greatest enemy, a \"strong deal\" and said that \"it will make our country safer, it will make our allies safer, and it will make the world safer.\"\u00a0   Netanyahu was so opposed to the Iran deal, which Lew championed, that he traveled to the United States and addressed a joint session of Congress to urge congressional opposition. Lew told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Iran \"will continue to be denied access to the [U.S.\u2019s] financial and commercial market.\" \u00a0 , An alphabet soup of Acts \u2014\u00a0The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), The Antiterrorism Act (ATA) and Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0have whittled away foreign sovereign immunity protections in favor of victims of terror attacks and their anguished survivors. Diplomacy \u2014 like easing sanctions, allowing economic growth, releasing prisoners and $6 billion in aid to Iran has gotten us nowhere but to the brink of a second front opening in this new war with another Iran-backed Foreign Terrorist Organization, Hezbollah.\u00a0 Justice for the bereft family members of terror victims is never swift or guaranteed. A constellation of U.S. laws allows the surviving family members of terror victims to sue nations that took part in the acts of terror either directly, or by providing financial backing and other assistance., But, when Jewish students respond to the same question, the figure more than doubles, with 55% of Jewish students stating that they cannot have a vulnerable discussion about Israel on their campuses.\u00a0  Although some students are pushing back against DEI offices that tolerate students advocating murdering others and glorifying  , countless students are scared, remaining silent and despondent, and feeling helpless. The liberal administrative machine and the anti-Israel climate on\u00a0collegiate campuses has made it difficult and dangerous for students to dissent\u00a0against the antisemitic notion that Israel is a colonizing, genocidal force.\u00a0 , Aissami is known to have longstanding contacts to Mideast nations and is believed by U.S. law enforcement to have provided false passports to Hamas and Hezbollah elements.\u00a0\u00a0  Beginning in 2005, Iran\u00a0began an initiative to increase\u00a0its presence in Latin America, opening six new embassies and putting the puppet-master of the current Gaza war at America\u2019s doorstep.\u00a0\u00a0  The focus on these groups has been a luxury belief of Washington elites made possible only by the cessation of the threat of Islamist extremism, due to the tireless work of previous intelligence and law enforcement officials. \u00a0 , Kennedy offers something for everybody, which threatens, especially, Joe Biden and to a lesser degree Donald Trump.\u00a0  Kennedy offers something for everybody, which threatens, especially, Joe Biden and to a lesser degree Donald Trump. Instead of trying to bring Saudi Arabia and Israel together, Biden went out of his way to insult the leaders of both those nations and instead courted the vicious mullahs of Iran, who just orchestrated the worst attack on Israel in 50 years., Vietnam refugee Hung Cao joined 'Fox &amp; Friends First' to discuss the possibility of a third-party candidate in the 2024 presidential election and his candidacy to oust Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, D. I learned to swim at the U.S. Embassy swimming pool in Niamey, Niger, in 1976. As a contingency, if we had to evacuate, the 75th Ranger Regiment was to surround Bagram Air Base while we flew everyone out, and they would fold in at the end and exfil.   to the Taliban before anything else, leaving us with no plan B. The additional U.S. Embassy evacuations in Ukraine, Belarus, Sudan, Haiti\u00a0and now Niger show Biden\u2019s failed foreign policy and weakness. While Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is bowing multiple times to greet Xi Xiping, and Secretary of State Tony Blinken is going on talk shows, China, Russia and Iran are collecting valuable diplomatic equity around the world.\u00a0 , House Subcommittee on Weaponization of the Federal Government Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, sounds off on 'Hannity.'  President Joe Biden and several members of his administration have used the power of the federal government to systematically and illegally silence political opposition through a \"far-reaching and widespread censorship campaign,\" according to federal district court judge Terry Doughty, who is presiding over the Missouri vs Biden case brought by the attorneys general from Missouri and Louisiana.\u00a0\u00a0  In his 4th of July decision blocking the Biden administration from continuing to operate as an \"Orwellian \u2018Ministry of Truth,\u2019\" Doughty includes scores of examples \u2013 requiring 82 pages in the factual section alone\u2013to show how the Biden government \"colluded with and/or coerced social-media platforms to suppress disfavored speakers.\" In his 4th of July decision blocking the Biden administration from continuing to operate as an   Doughty includes scores of examples \u2013 requiring 82 pages in the factual section alone\u2013to show how the Biden government \"colluded with and/or coerced social-media platforms to suppress disfavored speakers.\", Still, is it a match for the mob, the mob that disrupted subway service and started brawls over the death of a violent, mentally ill homeless man? The subway event had to be staged because there's no way those kids jump onto a live subway track and stay there without knowing the train wouldn't turn them into ground chuck. Greg Gutfeld currently serves as host of\u00a0 \u00a0(weeknights, 11PM-12AM/ET) and co-host of cable news\u2019 highest-rated program  \u00a0(weekdays, 5-6PM/ET).\u00a0, Yet just a few years ago, Erdogan kept Washington busy with one issue after another: from threatening our fellow ally Greece and aggressively challenging French warships in the Mediterranean, to blocking the approval of NATO war plans in Brussels and buying advanced air defense systems \u2013 designed to defeat U.S. aircraft -- from Moscow, just to name a few. As such, Sweden has taken several steps over the past year to address his concerns, from amending its constitution and passing legislation that tightens the country\u2019s anti-terrorism laws, to taking a harder line toward the PKK (and their affiliates) and ending its arms embargo against Ankara. Over the years, this proud Scandinavian country has conducted military exercises with NATO, shared intelligence, developed effective weapons and equipment, and ensured its armed forces (especially its maritime capabilities) are modern and compatible with its future allies., We found a Chinese physician, a scientific researcher who worked for the Chinese government, who was in and around Wuhan when COVID emerged from that lab. So there was a physician who worked on coronaviruses for the Chinese military, who was in Wuhan, telling us in September of 2020 that the Chinese government did this intentionally to wreck the West, to kill people and destroy the economies of its rivals here in the West. Now, these Chinese scientific researchers scolded the Chinese government for the lax safety standards that they said allowed COVID to escape and infect the world., \"It may be time away from a professional role, but it's very much time on\" and actually, it was time on \u2013 time on television, Pete Buttigieg used his time to appear on various shows, including \"The View\" on ABC, where he spoke at length about his favorite subject, which is himself. Weeks after a train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, causing an actual environmental disaster throughout the whole region, Pete Buttigieg as of tonight has still not visited East Palestine. But for much of the time this disaster was unfolding, Joe Biden's secretary of  , that would be Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, was completely disengaged., Kevin McCarthy has taken decisive action as  \u00a0That includes his appointing Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, a conservative bulldog who, as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, is convening hearings on how Big Tech has colluded with the federal government to suppress free speech. Under McCarthy\u2019s speakership, one thing is certain: Congress will be aggressive in the hearings on Big Tech\u2019s collusion with the government and lying under oath about censorship. If Congress acts against Big Tech\u2019s assault on free speech now, its reforms will not only protect open expression, but also data privacy and\u202fchildren's safety., But it happened to the poor benighted town of East Palestine, Ohio, whose people are forgotten And in the view of the people who lead this country, forgettable. So this train derailment was an environmental disaster, not an \"environmental disaster\" like climate change is, but an actual environmental disaster, a disaster that's hurting actual people. That's yet another day that we celebrate race-based federal funding, that, despite the trail train derailment, does not apply to East Palestine because the people who live there are the wrong color., In short, Jexodus wasn\u2019t merely significant to New York: amid otherwise terrible midterm performance, the 2022 Jexodus vote was perhaps the key factor delivering the House to the GOP. \u00a0  In short, Jexodus wasn\u2019t merely significant to New York: amid otherwise terrible midterm performance, the 2022 Jexodus vote was perhaps the key factor delivering the House to the GOP. \u00a0  In the run-up to November\u2019s election,\u202fThe New York Times\u202fran a hit piece smearing private Jewish religious schools \u2014 just in time for New York\u2019s Democrat-run Board of Regents to denounce them and demand control.\u00a0 , Kinzinger's often expressed concern for Syria's men, women and children is what matters and because that concern matters so much, Kinzinger has pushed hard to continue the neocon proxy war in Syria. \u00a0 Results? Kinzinger made that clear the other day when he responded personally to a Twitter account called \"Catturd\" because when you're one of Washington's leading authorities on foreign policy, you spend a lot of time on Twitter reading accounts with names like \"Catturd.\" \u00a0  So, the other day, \"Catturd\" made the mistake of posting a meme that seemed to mock the colors of the Ukrainian flag, colors that are sacred to Adam Kinzinger and every other empathetic soccer mom in her mid-40s., This state visit of the leader of France, our country\u2019s oldest ally, provides the first lady an opportunity to create her own style of entertaining a world leader, just as President Ulysses S. Grant and first lady Julia Grant did when they\u00a0began the tradition of state dinners in 1874 by hosting King David Kalakaua of Hawaii. The grand   tradition of hosting foreign leaders and monarchs resumes Thursday night when President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden host their first state dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte. Here\u2019s a look at how Mrs. Biden\u2019s predecessors handled state dinners over the past six decades: No first lady did more to enhance entertaining at the White House than Jacqueline Kennedy., When the USVSST was established in 2015, two groups of victims were left out: 9/11 victims who had received Victims Compensation Fund payments, and Beirut Marine barracks bombing victims (and a few others who joined their case) who pursued enforcement of their legal judgements against Iran. Thirty-nine years ago,   drove a truck laden with explosives into the U.S. Marine Corps barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, killing 241 U.S. service members \u2014 220 Marines, 18 sailors, and three soldiers \u2014 and severely injuring many others.\u00a0  This bill would rescind and redirect $3 billion in unused CARES Act funds to further compensate 9/11 victims who had been originally excluded from the U.S. Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund (USVSST).\u00a0 , \"When our Marines, sent to Lebanon on a multinational peacekeeping mission with the consent of the United States Congress, were murdered in their sleep, the \u2018blame America first crowd\u2019 didn't blame the terrorists who murdered the Marines, they blamed the United States.\u00a0  \"When Marxist dictators shoot their way to power in Central America, the San Francisco Democrats don't blame the guerrillas and their Soviet allies, they blame United States policies of 100 years ago.\u00a0  \"\u00a0 In the last 38 years, \"blame America first\" has metastasized into \"weaken America first., And imagine if the weapons that were left in Afghanistan are traced back against the attacks that happened?\"\u00a0 Massoud\u00a0should know because his father was the Lion of the Panjshir, Ahmad Shah\u00a0Massoud, Leader of the Northern Alliance, who warned the European Parliament in April 2001 of a brewing AQ attack against the U.S. The wholesale abandonment of Afghanistan not only casts serious doubt on the United States\u2019 willingness to honor its promises to its allies, but it has hastened a return of a terrorist\u00a0safe haven\u00a0in Afghanistan that is worse than before. Afghan special operators have been high-priority targets of the Taliban since U.S. military forces withdrew from Afghanistan last year, former Green Beret says., Under the Trump administration, the U.S. designated Iranian entities, including the Ministry of Petroleum, National Iranian Oil Company, and National Iranian Tanker Company, because of their longstanding ties to terrorism and applied \"maximum economic pressure\" on Iran. A significant portion of the $30 billion that the Iranian regime was able to capture from evading lawful sanctions supports the Iranian police, including the so-called \"morality police\" unit responsible for the death of Mahsa Amini in September, the Basij paramilitary forces targeting their fellow citizens today, and human rights abusers in the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). Much more, however, is required to slow Iran\u2019s military and terror buildup, enhance U.S. security, support the Iranian people, and relieve the buildup of military pressure against our allies and partners in the region. \u00a0 , Writing in the Jewish Journal, Kenneth L. Marcus, a former assistant U.S. secretary of Education for Civil Rights and an alumnus of U-C Berkeley Law School, notes: \"Berkeley law students are not the first to exclude Zionists. They include Women of Berkeley Law, Asian Pacific American Law Students Association, Middle Eastern and North African Law Students Association, Law Students of African Descent and the Queer Caucus.\u00a0 \u00a0  Isn't that the point of those who support critical race theory?\u00a0 \u00a0 Especially with America's history during World War II when the Roosevelt administration limited the number of Jews desperately fleeing Nazi Germany to enter this country, Berkeley and other students should be more welcoming to Jews, protect their free speech, and not silence them.\u00a0 , While the people of Iran fight for basic human rights,   with the Islamic Republic of Iran \u2014 the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terror \u2014 to establish a new nuclear deal weaker than the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), giving them the ability to restore their nuclear proliferation program.\u00a0  Biden\u2019s weakened Iran deal would reportedly also release up to $275 billion in frozen reserves to Iran, and it is almost certain Iran would use this funding to perpetuate terrorist activities. This deal with Iran will set into motion a destructive domino effect that is the culmination of the Biden administration\u2019s failed policies with regard to Iran, Russia, the People\u2019s Republic of China and Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.\u00a0 , Donald Trump was elected president and then a few days later, displaying the independence of spirit that Democrats claim to love in young women but actually despise more than anything, Tulsi Gabbard decided to talk to the new president about an issue that she cared about, which was U.S. policy toward Syria, a country that, again, Gabbard was virtually alone in pointing out has an awful lot of Christians in it, so maybe we should pay attention.\u00a0  When Tulsi Gabbard won the Democratic Party's primary for a congressional seat in Hawaii 10 years ago, she'd effectively won the seat. But Tulsi Gabbard \u2013 as someone who had served in the U.S. military, in fact was still serving in the U.S. military, was an elected member of Congress \u2013 decided, why shouldn't I say what I think?, That\u2019s also why a group of Democrat lawmakers   begging the White House to continue releasing oil from the SPR through year-end \"at a minimum\", in order\u00a0\"to ensure that gasoline and oil prices continue their downward trajectory\u2026\"\u00a0 Unhappily for Democrats (and all Americans) OPEC+ is meeting this week and is reportedly set to cut oil production more than one million barrels per day in order to boost prices. But the Biden White House has made us vulnerable to the whims of foreign (and some unfriendly) producers; that is inexcusable.   undertake an \"all hands on deck\" effort to raise U.S. oil and gas production, which would lower global oil prices and boost our economy. The greeting chosen by Joe Biden to virtue-signal that he would   deign to shake hands with Mohammed bin Salman, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, even as he begged OPEC\u2019s de facto head for more oil?, The government must assume the care and management of Afghan special operations partner forces and other at-risk, high-impact Afghan security officials from veteran groups.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0  Afghan special operators have been high-priority targets of the Taliban since U.S. military forces withdrew from Afghanistan last year, former Green Beret says. To prevent this from happening ever again, our combat veterans and civilians built partnerships with Afghan police, soldiers, nonprofits, Afghan schools, and a myriad of other organizations., James Jeffrey, a former ambassador to Iraq who served under former  as a special representative to Syria, said that former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had given Iraqi politicians a clear choice \u2013 either side with Iran and risk America\u2019s substantial military, economic and political support, or push back against Iranian encroachment.\u00a0    Asked Monday about complaints by Schenker about the administration\u2019s apparent indifference to the political deadlock and growing Iraqi violence, Vedant Patel, the State Department\u2019s principal deputy spokesman, said that the administration has \"consistently reaffirmed the U.S. Government\u2019s commitment to a strong, stable, and prosperous Iraq.\" Former CIA Station Chief Dan Hoffman discusses his thoughts on Biden's Iran nuclear deal and the threat that Iran poses in the region On the eve of a potential nuclear deal with neighboring Iran,  ., That chart, as compared to the published final numbers for her pre-COVID, first-year-in-office, looks like this:\u00a0\u00a0 17,684 \u00a0 11,709\u00a0 Meaning: At the current pace, AOC will finish this year with a 51.02% increase in major crime since her first year in office. \u00a0  The   According to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s official government webpage, her 14th congressional district represents more than 650,000 people from the following neighborhoods:\u00a0   Astoria, College Point, Corona,\u202fNorth Corona, East Elmhurst, Elmhurst, Jackson Heights, Sunnyside and Woodside in Queens;\u00a0 Pelham\u202fGardens, City Island, Country\u202fClub, Van Nest, Morris Park, Parkchester, Pelham Bay, Schuylerville, Allerton and Throggs Neck in the Bronx\u00a0 So: by simply correlating those areas to the NYPD\u2019s official precinct webpages, we find that   all or part of the following precincts:\u00a0the 43, 45, and 49 in the Bronx; and the 108, 109, 110, 114, and 115 in Queens. \u00a0  For the seven majors through the year\u2019s 29th week, the chart looks like this:\u00a0\u00a0 9,862 \u00a06,280 \u00a0 So year-to-date, from pre-COVID to now, AOC is up 57.03%.\u00a0 , An economy that runs on renewable and clean energy will improve people\u2019s health and wellbeing; reduce energy costs for consumers; minimize drastic energy price swings; create good paying jobs; and promote national security and global stability.\u00a0\u00a0  Our collective success will require all of us who take climate change seriously to convince the American people, especially skeptics, that passing an aggressive clean energy package is an opportunity to not only tackle climate change, but also address some of the pain points that Americans across the country are feeling right now. A renewable and clean energy economy would help combat inflation and bring more affordable, stable energy to consumers, insulating folks from the volatility we see today in the price of gas, utilities, and everyday goods., Joining NATO brings   into a common air defense picture, extends NATO\u2019s cyber resilience capabilities, and the NATO nuclear deterrence guarantee is included, too.\u00a0    What\u2019s the point of non-alignment when the other camp contains a thug like Putin?\u00a0 Finland, Sweden and NATO have sent a message to Putin: the good guys are adding teammates. Putin\u2019s aggression and the reality of modern war made it urgent for Finland and Sweden to become full members of NATO., It is imperative that we recognize the legitimate national security concerns of Turkey, create buffer zones between the elements that Turkey views as terrorist groups, \u00a0support those who helped us destroy the physical caliphate, and ensure that ISIS does not reemerge. There are oil fields in northeastern Syria that, with more investment, could produce larger quantities of oil \u2013 a benefit to both the world oil market and the economies of northeastern Syria and Turkey. Unfortunately, nothing was done and Turkey moved into northeastern Syria several years ago because of their concerns regarding Kurdish elements launching terrorist acts from northeastern Syria., Instead of the Biden administration calling on Venezuela, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and other nations that don\u2019t have our best interests in mind to produce more energy, we must instead put faith back in our\u00a0domestic\u00a0energy producers to meet our energy needs. Here are five reasons why the Biden administration should support\u00a0domestic\u00a0drilling: While energy prices are influenced by a broad range of factors\u2014both in and outside of our control\u2014 there\u2019s no doubt that U.S. policy plays a key role in shaping the price that Americans see at the pump.\u00a0    The solution to our troubles lies beneath our feet, and unleashing American oil and natural gas resources through\u00a0domestic\u00a0drilling\u00a0is our only chance to curb inflation and rebuild America\u2019s economic might.\u00a0   , The Poles have chosen to forget Ukrainian crimes against them, including ancient and new, in particular the genocide and ethnic cleansing of Polish villages by the Ukrainian nationalists during the Second World War. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has produced Europe\u2019s gravest refugee crisis arguably since the Second World War. Others point out that Ukrainian nationalists lay claims to south-eastern Polish territory., But Washington being Washington, commentators have focused on McFarlane\u2019s role in the Iran Contra affair, the scandal du jour of the later years of the Reagan administration, when U.S. officials tried unsuccessfully to reestablish a relationship with Iran.\u00a0    To focus primarily on the scandal misses the role McFarlane played as an unsung hero in Reagan\u2019s ultimate Cold War victory over the Soviet Union. They began by: *Restoring America\u2019s economic health and growth *Rebuilding and modernizing America\u2019s military *Revitalizing the NATO alliance\u00a0 *Halting transfer of American technology to the USSR *Blocking Soviet access to the western capital and banks., \"\u00a0 If we re-enter the JCPOA or some variation of it, undoubtedly there will come a time when American, Middle Eastern and European children ask a similar and horrifying question, wondering, incredulously, how we did not save the Middle East, and many countries well beyond, when we had all the signs clearly laid out that appeasement of the Iranian regime will lead to a disaster of epic proportions.\u00a0  The Iranian regime is watching as it sees the enormous leverage Russia has from the threat of nuclear weapons which could be used against any country standing in Russia\u2019s way. The Iranian regime is watching as it sees the enormous leverage Russia has from the threat of nuclear weapons which could be used against any country standing in Russia\u2019s way., And then there are those who don\u2019t even try to defend Israel \u2013 they just throw up their hands in defeat, arguing that we must cut loose anti-Israel sentiment from the definition of antisemitism \u2013 in other words, condone anti-Zionism as the price for leaving American Jews alone.\u00a0  Some experts posit that misperceptions of Israel and its policies are the root cause of the rise in antisemitism and push for greater education on Israel and the risks it faces from its enemies.\u00a0  He has guided unprecedented advancements in the US-Israel relationship, including moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem and brokering the Abraham Accords \u2014 peace agreements between Israel and five Muslim Nations \u2014 for which he was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize and awarded the National Security Medal., The Biden White House is desperate to rejoin the JCPOA, aka the Iran nuclear agreement that Trump exited in 2018, reportedly offering the most malignant actor in the Middle East tens of billions of dollars in freed-up funds and removal of crippling sanctions in exchange for an unverifiable pause in its effort to build a nuclear weapon. And yet, Biden\u2019s Health and Human Service Secretary Xavier Becerra just extended the national public-health \"emergency\" for another three months, which allows people to receive expanded food stamp benefits and Medicaid, without the usual work or job training requirements. Meanwhile, even though Becerra is telling Americans the health emergency is ongoing, the Biden White House is moving towards lifting Title 42, which allows migrants illegally crossing into the U.S. to be quickly expelled \u2013  .\u00a0, According the Times, internal disagreements on   policy, and particularly whether to keep the Trump administration\u2019s \"remain in Mexico\" approach, have exposed serious fault lines inside the administration between those who worry about the political consequences of the border crisis, and those who want to reject everything the previous administration did on immigration.\u00a0  In the George W. Bush administration, infighting among various factions over America\u2019s Iraq policy led to the single nastiest thing done between rivals in an administration.\u00a0 In the Nixon administration, national security adviser Henry Kissinger sought to keep Secretary of State William Rogers out of the loop on the administration\u2019s outreach to China.\u00a0\u00a0   , : On Feb. 4,   and Xi Jinping, announced that China and Russia had signed an\u00a0  \u2013 5,000 words, very detailed \u2013 with each side pledging to the other that they would support mutual efforts to supplant the United States as the world's primary power and make the world safe for the survival of Russian and Chinese tyranny.\u00a0  We have to give priority to China, but this threat to freedom is interrelated the way the dictators of the 1930s \u2013 Mussolini, Tojo and the greatest of the danger, Hitler \u2013 cooperated loosely to undermine the West when the West radiated weakness, when Britain and France brought appeasement to its apotheosis in the 1930s, and when the United States remained complacently isolationist until it was nearly too late. For years, with honorable exceptions, there's been a wide consensus operating on the delusion that Russia is a partner for peace, and China seeks to become part of our system \u2026 This pact should be a warning call that this is not the case and that the free world, and the United States in particular, will have to take seriously the imperative of vigilance across the board, dealing with this threat., \"But no one can do anything,\" says Ivan.\u00a0         Olga, a 35-year-old woman I spoke to, was a month ago only worried about growing her beauty salon in the once-bustling port city and the increasing independence of her 19-year-old son. The targeting of civilians in mass bombing campaigns is designed to force Ukraine's population into submission, to convince residents in larger cities like Kyiv that resistance is futile and will only lead to total devastation and huge death tolls.\u00a0  But while war zones are inherently cruel, few are designed like Mariupol \u2014 aimed to inflict maximum human suffering, to be Putin's funhouse of terror.\u00a0 , Phase I \u2013 Build Combat Power; Phase II \u2013 Condition Setting; Phase III \u2013 Assault the Objective; and Phase IV \u2013 Secure a Destroyed Kyiv. The fighting in the city will be intense, and the loss of life will degrade Russian capability, but the cost in human capital of securing the terrain that was captured will also significantly reduce combat power as the Russian Army assaults Kyiv.\u00a0Failure to secure the terrain exposes the assaulting forces to attacks from their rear.\u00a0 \"\u00a0 Terrain denial by use of persistent chemical agents, use of a non-persistent agent to uproot and expose Ukrainian fighters and their defensive positions, and the use of a\u00a0thermobaric weapon \u2013 aerosol bomb, fuel air explosive (FAE)\u00a0to destroy hardened fighting positions or command-and-control centers in civilian populated areas \u2013 all are violations of International Law., In 2018, President Trump ordered U.S. airstrikes against Assad regime targets after they breached Trump\u2019s own red line on the use of chemical weapons. There are several other actions the U.S. can still take in the near term, such as cutting off Russian-led nuclear negotiations with Iran, allowing for the transfer of fighter jets and surface-to-air weapons to Ukraine, and placing additional pressure on India and China to sever economic ties to Russia.\u00a0\u00a0  Deterrence was restored and the Trump administration sent a clear message around the globe that they would not stand for attacks against our troops or the use of chemical weapons., On Wednesday, 56 of them   a Scottish National party amendment calling for an immediate ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war, and directly defying the party leader, Sir Keir Starmer, who wanted his MPs to abstain and back a policy of humanitarian pauses. If Labour returns to power, divisions of this kind would be likely to affect party management on foreign policy, just as they did in the past over Iraq and Syria. More than a quarter of Labour MPs took part, in spite of a protracted effort by Sir Keir and his aides., So if you don\u2019t eat pigs, and we don\u2019t eat pigs, why not, not eat pigs together?\u201d And the murder of 1,400 Israeli civilians does not excuse the murderous collective punishment meted out on civilians in Gaza by the Israel Defence Forces. Although I\u2019ve never called myself a Zionist, I recognise how the wretched darkness of the Holocaust and the murder of six million Jews led the world, via the UN, to agree to Israel\u2019s foundation., Like anyone seriously engaging with the past weeks\u2019 events, they know Israel\u2019s government is hardly being subtle: that this weekend, a minister   was instituting a new Nakba, the expulsion of 700,000 Palestinians in 1948; that the defence minister justified a total siege on the grounds Israel was fighting  \u201d. To assuage their own guilty consciences, those who support him are quick to suggest that Starmer\u2019s positioning is irrelevant to what happens, even though Labour\u2019s refusal to push the government in turn helps Rishi Sunak to continue offering Israel carte blanche. The former shadow minister Yasmin Qureshi quoted UN warnings of Gaza becoming a  ; while Naz Shah resigned warning of a humanitarian catastrophe, rightly declaring \u201chistory judges us, and there are moments like this when we have to take a position\u201d., Just as the mothers of the   met every Thursday at 3.30pm, I appeal to the mothers of the world to meet every day at 3pm \u2013 the time of Nawraz\u2019s son\u2019s death \u2013 to mark the suffering of Palestinian mothers and children. No mother should have to pull their dead child\u2019s body from the rubble of the family home because a two-tonne bomb has been dropped on it while she was out shopping. Before leaving the house for essentials, Fadel\u2019s grandfather overheard him explaining to his closest friend, Ahmad, that he had secretly saved enough money to surprise his mother, Neda, with a birthday gift., When the fighting resumes, we are forced to wonder: what good is a humanitarian pause for aid if the killing doesn\u2019t stop? To say that the situation is exceptional does not begin to describe the reality of nonstop Israeli bombardments, huge missile strikes from air, land, and sea, and the collective struggle to stay alive. If you want to give aid and be humanitarian then the killing must stop, through an immediate ceasefire., My organisation, Standing Together, a grassroots political movement of Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel,   to help the thousands of Arab workers  , and the many Arab students facing disciplinary charges in their universities. That is why we\u2019ve formed the Jewish-Arab Solidarity Network with more than 12 local groups in cities across the country, which works on the ground to combat racism, promote peace and equality, and bring Jewish and Palestinian citizens together. Uri Weltmann is the national field organiser of  , a grassroots political movement of Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel that organises for peace, equality and social justice, After the Anti-Defamation League and the Louis D Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law issued an open letter calling on university presidents to investigate pro-Palestinian student groups, the American Civil Liberties Union   with its own  , which \u201cunequivocally urges universities to reject calls to investigate, disband, or penalize pro-Palestinian student groups for exercising their free speech rights\u201d. There certainly is objectionable speech out there, but the answer to speech you don\u2019t like must always be to engage more speech, not to employ lies, half-truths, and wilful distortions to shut down someone else\u2019s speech. he Downingtown area school district, the   school district in Pennsylvania, claims to be \u201ca twenty-first century district with the idealistic warmth and charm of a small town\u201d., Mostly free of the pogroms that were a feature of Christian Europe, these communities were uprooted by a pincer of competing forces: Jewish nationalism in Israel and the Arab nationalisms of countries such as Iraq, trying to shake off the yoke of British imperialism. Protesters  , catastrophe and terror being inflicted on Palestinians in Gaza.   are accelerating globally, as   people have been killed in the sealed Gaza Strip, including over 4,000 children \u2013 and with thousands more injured or orphaned. It means we can view the Palestinian Nakba (catastrophe), the Holocaust and the exodus of Jews from Arab lands as a tangle of communities caught in the expanse of European colonialism and extreme racial thinking., While Palestinian journalists have been phenomenally brave and extensive in their coverage, too much of the international mainstream media has insisted on giving credence to Israeli regime officials: for example, when they provided \u201cproof\u201d of a recording of a conversation between Palestinians claiming responsibility for the al-Ahli Arab hospital bombing. This was demonstrated par excellence following the Israeli army expulsion order for 1.1 million people in northern Gaza, when they told the world that they would allow for safe routes for Palestinians to head south. The Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said they were fighting \u201c \u201d and the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, called Palestinians \u201cchildren of darkness\u201d  ., Publicly, that same centre-left politician trumpets Germany\u2019s pro-Israel stance in the media at every opportunity, but simultaneously appears to dog-whistle to the antisemitic far right by framing Germany as powerless but to accept Israel\u2019s demands, even if the result of its bombardment is massive loss of civilian life in Gaza. When I recently published a book about this widespread displacement of Jewish people in Germany by single-minded opportunists, the reaction was indicative: a journalist writing for a German Jewish newspaper put it all down to Israel-hatred and my supposed post-traumatic stress as a woman who had left the ultra-orthodox community. I have also discovered that a transactional relationship defines the public representation of Jews in Germany \u2013 and it obscures the views of an unseen majority of Jewish people who don\u2019t belong to communities financially supported by the German state, and don\u2019t constantly emphasise the singular importance of unconditional loyalty to the state of  ., And then someone from the next block over would shout it to the next block, until it travelled, block to block, window to window, all the way to the nearest civil defence station or ambulance team, who would then race into action. The tanks are patrolling Rashid Street, the coastal road that runs between Gaza City and Wadi Gaza. During the day, the Israeli forces attack the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship hospital, south of Gaza City., Braverman and columnists and commentators such as Sarah Vine at the   and the fascism-downplayer Douglas Murray at the   (\u201cI don\u2019t see why no one should be allowed to love their country because the Germans mucked up twice in a century\u201d) have thrown petrol on to it, deliberately striving to make the desire to honour the war dead of the past incompatible with the desire to prevent further war death in the present. I\u2019ve worn a poppy with pride every year since I was a choirboy, singing around Solihull war memorial on Remembrance Sunday in the suede denim 1970s, where the solemnity of the situation and the stark beauty of the Last Post momentarily softened even the talented young choirmaster\u2019s yearnings. People like the GB News character and doorstep swing-voter-faking liar MP Lee Anderson have changed the poppy\u2019s meaning somehow, making it a badge of allegiance to a whole raft of values I don\u2019t necessarily subscribe to, damning as beneath contempt anyone who, even inadvertently, neglects to wear the red flower., But if selection for a job rests solely on the CV and similar data, it would only be a matter of time before job applicants used AI to create their application and for employers to use AI to analyse and select the \u201cmost appropriate\u201d applicant. The English Folk Dance and Song Society archive lists 15 types of folk dance, from Early Morris to Longsword, Rapper and Molly, many no doubt with their own local variations (\u201c \u201d, News). The world of longevity research is producing important insights, but a bigger challenge remains reversing the decline in life expectancy affecting people in low-income occupations and deprived neighbourhoods., And by using incendiary terms like \u201chate marchers\u201d and \u201cmobs\u201d to mischaracterise whole marches of many thousands of people who are legitimately exercising their democratic right to protest, she implicitly encouraged far-right protesters to come out to counter-demonstrate on Armistice Day. The home secretary, Suella Braverman,   in the run-up to yesterday\u2019s march in London to protest against Israel\u2019s military action in Gaza: to throw caution to the wind, deploy inflammatory language and hint darkly at the worst-case scenarios that might take shape. As prime minister, he is ultimately responsible for his home secretary\u2019s behaviour: her undermining of the operational independence of the police and her stoking of tensions at a highly sensitive time, in a way that appears to coincide with what she believes to be in furtherance of her ambition to one day lead the Conservative party., What rightwingers term the new \u201caxis of evil\u201d \u2013 China, Russia and Iran \u2013 is turning the Gaza battle into an online world war, using state media and social networking platforms to boost Hamas and denigrate Israel and the US. What really interests Xi is how Israel\u2019s relentless assault on Gaza is making its US ally look weak and guilty by association in the eyes of the world while dividing the western democracies, alienating Arab states and discrediting the international rules-based order he hopes to replace. Sign up to  Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Xi says it is China\u2019s destiny to build \u201ca shared future for mankind\u201d., However, the vast difference in power between Israel and Hamas makes it highly unlikely for Hamas to pose an   threat to Israel. Dating back to Cleon\u2019s speech in Book 3 of Thucydides\u2019 The Peloponnesian War, the paradigm example of demagoguery in the ancient world, would-be genocidaires always justify their actions on the grounds that its targets pose an existential threat to their own people. To justify mass killing by self-protection, by the claim that its targets pose an existential threat, is the  justification for genocide., Operationally, this could entail forming an Arab-Palestinian Authority-international peacekeeping force to take over from Israeli forces after Hamas\u2019s defeat, unifying the West Bank and Gaza Strip under PA control, reviving Israeli-Palestinian negotiations over a final status settlement, and promoting regional security and stability by pursuing normalisation with Riyadh along with a massive injection of Saudi or Gulf moneys to rebuild the devastated Strip. However, putting aside the more extreme voices seeking to permanently depopulate the Strip or nuke it to oblivion, two largely consensual goals can be adduced from the Israeli stance so far: the first is that Hamas must be unequivocally defeated and its military and political-civilian presence uprooted from Gaza once and for all; and the second, that there should be no return to the status quo ante \u2013 that is, that any post-Hamas regime must be consistent with Israel\u2019s security needs and the trauma suffered by the Israeli people on 7 October. All have been born from Gaza\u2019s searing 75-year-old experience with brute Israeli force, from mowing down refugees seeking to return to their homes and fields in the \u201cGaza envelope\u201d after 1948 through the massacres of unarmed protesters during the first Israeli occupation of 1956, Ariel Sharon\u2019s brutal \u201cpacification\u201d campaign in 1970-71, the era of settler occupation up to 2005, the dozen Israeli operations against Gaza   the 2005 withdrawal, to the siege and repeated bloody assaults since., Mr Netanyahu leads the most rightwing government in Israel\u2019s history: one minister recently   dropping a nuclear bomb on Gaza. This political strategy sought through unassailable military strength to end claims for an independent Palestinian state over the West Bank and Gaza with a capital city in East Jerusalem. Unfortunately, he is more likely to hear the words of his younger brother, Iddo, who   last Thursday that only the urgent \u201cterrible fear of our power\u201d could pacify Palestinians, rather than Israel waiting for them to rid themselves of \u201cabysmal hatred\u201d., How many know that far from enabling the creation of a Jewish national home in Palestine, as it had promised in 1917, the British empire  , all but blocking Jewish emigration to Palestine in 1939, at precisely the time it was needed most \u2013 when Jews were desperate to flee Nazi-occupied Europe? It also rests on an assumption that Israeli lives are \u201cwhite lives\u201d \u2013 when in fact about half of all Israeli Jews are not white by any definition, but  , with roots in north Africa and the Arab world, most of them the descendants of refugees pogromed out of their homes in Iraq, Yemen, Morocco or beyond in the aftermath of Israel\u2019s creation in 1948. But how many of those now branding Israel as a settler-colonialist entity \u2013 the better to fit their ideology \u2013 know that by the late 1940s, the push for Israel\u2019s establishment came in   of the British empire, to the extent that plenty of British leftists and anti-imperialists were marching back then not against Zionism but for it?, I call upon state parties to the ICC and non-state parties to help collectively vindicate the Geneva conventions, to help collectively vindicate principles of customary international law and also principles of the Rome statute, to share evidence regarding any allegations or any crimes so that we can properly investigate them and prosecute them as appropriate. In this context, I would also underline that the indiscriminate firing of rockets from Gaza into Israel may represent breaches of international humanitarian law subject to the jurisdiction of the ICC. While Israel is not one of the 123 countries that are   to the Rome statute, I stand ready to work with their national authorities, and with the families of victims in Israel, to complement domestic efforts and ensure that justice is delivered for those affected by these crimes., It is hard to avoid the shocking conclusion that this home secretary \u2013 the minister responsible for policing \u2013 would now probably welcome some scenes of disorder in London this weekend. o home secretary should write   that Suella Braverman published in the Times on Thursday and expect to remain in post. Ms Braverman\u2019s most serious constitutional offence, though, is to subvert the operational independence of the Metropolitan police., She called the rally a \u201c \u201d and accused the Met police of bias against Israel, comparing its approach unfavourably with the tough treatment meted out by police to sectarians in Northern Ireland, football supporters and anti-lockdown campaigners. ow to police a London demonstration should not be a political decision, whether for the prime minister, the home secretary or even an elected mayor. Rowley is appointed by and accountable to the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and to the home secretary, as well as to the Greater London Authority., Throughout most of the \u201cend of history\u201d, financiers thought they had an understanding with central banks: when times got rough, interest rates got slashed. In \u201cthe end of the end of history\u201d rates have shot up and will almost certainly stay high for years to come. \u201cThe end of history\u201d bred in British politics a lazy assumption that tomorrow would always be just like yesterday: there would be no fights in the backyard, the money men would keep coining it in, and prices were for ever heading south., Sir Mark Rowley, the Met commissioner, has taken the view that Saturday\u2019s march does not pose a threat to public safety. There would be few public demonstrations on any issue if the threshold for a ban were set at breaches of a prime minister\u2019s sense of decorum. Ms Braverman prefers the opposite approach, which is consistent with a pattern of treating any political situation as a platform for the advancement of personal ambition in the Conservative party., Until last month, Israel had ensured its security by heavy use of military and paramilitary forces, persistent control of populations and high levels of surveillance, together with well-resourced intelligence and security agencies. The war in Gaza is a microcosm of a global reliance on military responses to what are, at root, not military problems but problems that often relate to questions of justice, political representation and economic development. These questions force us to consider longer trends in modern warfare, linked not just to the post-9/11 \u201c \u201d but to a more global security paradigm that is about maintaining control, rather than addressing the underlying causes of revolt., Those numbers, it should be noted, only count the kids who are dying as a direct result of Israel\u2019s indiscriminate bombing. This article was amended on 13 November 2023 to make clearer that a reference to \u201chalf the people\u201d on pro-Palestinian marches being Jewish was in relation to events such as those in the linked articles, not to overall numbers among those marching. They don\u2019t count the kids who are so traumatized from being born in an open-air prison, so scarred from having their neighbourhoods and loved ones eradicated in an apocalyptic act of collective punishment, that their lives have changed for ever., The evening news coyly says scenes are \u201ctoo awful to show\u201d and then that \u201cviewers may find some scenes distressing\u201d, as if to draw us from whatever else we are doing. As with bad news generally, its appeal was said to be an evolutionary response to potential danger \u2013 humans crave a warning. or the first time in my adult life I cannot watch \u2013 or read \u2013 the news., The heavily armed soldier or policeman with his foot on someone\u2019s neck, the checkpoints and segregated streets and neighbourhoods \u2013 these images resonate with the past and present of people who have experienced power behave with impunity, who sense in their own societies a disparity in the value of people\u2019s lives. s the streets fill with ever-increasing numbers of pro-Palestine supporters \u2013 and with a large protest   next weekend \u2013 British politicians and commentators are coming up with new ways of describing what is happening: from \u201chate marches\u201d, in   home secretary Suella Braverman, to empty displays of \u201cvirtue signalling\u201d. It is also an injustice that is endorsed and enabled by western governments, which arm Israel in conflict and refuse to condemn its actions.   is not just directed at Israel, but at domestic governments and politicians who are seen as having a hand not just in the subjugation of stateless Palestinians, but in crafting an entire moral framework for it., While there has rightly been much criticism of leftwing voices celebrating the Hamas attack, far less has been said about the immensely more powerful political figures promoting incendiary, dehumanising rhetoric in the name of defending Israel, and the role of such rhetoric in justifying atrocities in Gaza. It is an attempt to reframe the Gazan conflict as a moral, rather than political, issue, and to delegitimise Palestinian perspectives, an approach that can only make political engagement on a difficult terrain even more intractible. Today, the answer depends on whether we, and political leaders in Israel, Palestine and the west, wish to listen to the Furies or to Athena.  , Since 7 October, the day Hamas fighters inflicted carnage on a music festival and on kibbutzim inside Israel, all the main parties \u2013 the three making up the government, plus the Conservative CDU opposition and even the far-right AfD \u2013 have spoken with one voice, in solidarity with Israel. Sign up to  The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion The next phase of the conflict should require a new dynamic, a determined diplomacy involving Israel, the US and Arab states to help find a long-term political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian impasse. Even so, commentators on the right have accused the German government of going soft on these protests, while civil liberties groups have accused German police of censorship and heavy-handedness., Overall, enhanced regional cooperation is bringing major investment deals signed during the past year, the first year of my administration, demonstrating growing international confidence in Iraq\u2019s economy. Here in Iraq, we stand in strong solidarity with the Palestinian people, and our country has committed to providing substantial aid, all the while working with our international partners to bring a swift end to this tragedy. We have reaffirmed Iraq\u2019s crucial role in working to protect political and economic security in the region through cooperation with our international partners., In testimony to Congress this week, Blinken   that, with Hamas out of the picture, the right body for that task would be the Palestinian Authority currently in place in the West Bank and dominated by Hamas\u2019s rivals, Fatah \u2013 who remain partitionists rather than maximalists. Yes, some in Hamas  , but past experience suggests if there\u2019s a chance of an agreement that entails any outcome other than the annihilation of Israel, then the maximalists of Hamas will veto it with violence. Right now, that moment \u2013 what diplomats and others refer to as \u201c \u201d \u2013 seems a long way off, though the visit to Israel   of the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, suggests that Washington is already looking at its watch: proof that even some of Israel\u2019s staunchest allies are alarmed by the mounting loss of life in Gaza., So, the question now is whether Labour is capable of effective government \u2013 not just in managing the day-to-day administration, but in responding to potentially world-changing events that require moral judgments and fundamental political choices. If there is to be a pause, I would suggest it should be a very brief pause within the Labour party to assess the moral basis upon which decisions are being taken, and for reflection on whether they align with the moral compass that has directed our party since its foundation. The recitation of ineffective calls for Israel to abide by international law when the indiscriminate effects of its bombing are self-evidents calls into question yet again the moral judgments being made at the centre of the Labour administration., Hamas\u2019s war aim (unstated, and therefore speculative) is presumably to provoke Israel to commit such barbarities in response to its terrorist attack that it loses international support and becomes, ultimately, forced to make major concessions to the Palestinians in the form of a genuinely autonomous state. This exacerbates the polarisation, and calls into question whether a two-state solution is still a viable endpoint, or whether only a one-state solution, with Israelis and Palestinians full and equal citizens in a single state, would create the necessary pressures to moderation to bring lasting peace in the region. Both common humanity, given the level of suffering, and the need to retain international backing, should persuade Israel to allow humanitarian aid \u2013 food, water, medicines \u2013 to reach the people of Gaza as swiftly as possible, a case urged by both   and  ., In the quest for normalised relations with Arab states, Israel\u2019s leaders treated the Palestinians as a defeated people and ignored the cautions of a bevy of analysts of a ferocious explosion if Israel persisted with its occupation of the land and lives of another people. It is not clear that the mass killings and kidnappings of Israelis, the consequent slaughter of Palestinians and the reduction of   to rubble had a higher purpose \u2013 with the possible exceptions of forestalling closer Saudi-Israel relations and the elevation of Hamas over the Palestinian Authority. A few weeks before Israel was caught off guard by the Egyptian-Syrian military offensive in 1973, the Israeli prime minister, Golda Meir, told me that if the Arabs were to start a war, she would \u201cfeel sorry for the Arabs\u201d., And yet, I hesitate to see the value in admonishments during the current conflict towards those who have kept their counsel online \u2013 from celebrities such as Jewish actor Noah Schnapp, who   his feeds were \u201cchillingly quiet\u201d following Hamas\u2019s attacks on Israel, to Palestinian friends and internet strangers proclaiming that \u201cthe silence is deafening\u201d after Israel\u2019s bombardment of Gaza. If social media is the modern agora, then criticism of those not speaking out on important issues seems valid \u2013 especially if one is a public figure with a large social media following. His words, along with the Dietrich Bonhoeffer quote, \u201cSilence in the face of evil is itself evil\u201d, have spread on social platforms following the latest outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas., Killing innocent Palestinian women and children in Gaza will not bring back to life the innocent Israeli women and children who were killed by Hamas.   Such a strategy must include, as minimum first steps: a clear promise that Palestinians displaced in the fighting will have the absolute right to safely return to their homes; a commitment to broader peace talks to advance a two-state solution in the wake of this war; an abandonment of Israeli efforts to carve up and annex the West Bank; and a commitment to work with the international community to build genuine Palestinian governing capacity. Netanyahu and his extremist partners had worked to marginalize Palestinian voices committed to peace, pursued settlement policies designed to foreclose the possibility of a two-state solution, stymied economic development in Palestinian areas, and passed laws that entrench systemic inequality between the Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel., I now reside in Canada but my family home still stands in that same Khan Yunis camp, metres away from where the bombs fell, and it is where much of my extended family still live. These homes were packed with additional people who had fled from the Israeli bombardment of Gaza City when the bombs started to fall \u2013 one family to each room. Two-year-old Julia Abu Hussein, my sister\u2019s granddaughter, was in the living room of my family home eagerly awaiting the arrival of my niece, Rasha, to take her to the shop to buy sweets., As the then Jamaican chief minister, Norman Manley, explained: \u201cThe ban on trade with South Africa is a logical and proper act done in respect of a country which denies to its own people all the basic human rights and denies to coloured people all over the world every right of human rights intercourse. \u201cThe ongoing harsh conditions under which the Palestinians live in veritable colonialism and Israel\u2019s sense of insecurity will contribute to a cycle of violence until those realities are definitively addressed,\u201d Caricom said. or Jamaicans, the  UN general assembly vote on a call for a \u201chumanitarian truce\u201d in the Israel-Hamas war was more than just an embarrassing political effort to \u201cwalk between raindrops\u201d, as one government critic put it., But Labour has been   ever since Sir Keir Starmer appeared to say that\u00a0Israel had the right to impose a siege on Gaza, cutting off water and electricity, after the horrific massacre by Hamas of 1,400 Israelis. Sir Keir justifies war in northern Gaza in order to destroy Hamas. A human rights lawyer, Sir Keir could not say whether Israel had broken international law or whether its actions were morally justifiable., Julie, alongside Dr Lindsay Simmonds, a Jewish academic who researches women of faith and peacebuilding, felt the need to create a third space outside religious institutions and political organisations. \u201cIt takes courage and vulnerability to come into a space like this,\u201d said Julie Siddiqi, the Muslim co-organiser and a faith-relations consultant. \u201cThink of the  , or  , a grassroots initiative in Israel and Palestine comprising thousands of Palestinian and Israeli women, who even now continue to work for peace on the ground., Take Adania Shibli, the celebrated Palestinian author awarded Germany\u2019s 2023 LiBeraturpreis prize for her novel Minor Detail, which told the true story of an Israeli soldier\u2019s rape and murder of a Palestinian Bedouin girl in 1949. Cabinet minister Michelle Donelan defended her higher education (freedom of speech) bill last year   \u201cacademic freedom in these institutions is being undermined in a way that endangers our entire democracy\u201d, adding, \u201cwe find academics self-censoring themselves out of fear\u201d. However, last weekend, in a letter to UK Research and Innovation, she expressed her \u201cdisgust and outrage\u201d at its appointment of two academics to its advisory group on equality, diversity and inclusion, one of whom \u2013 in her own words \u2013 \u201ccondemns violence on both sides but make reference to Israel\u2019s \u2018genocide and apartheid\u2019\u201d., A spokesperson for Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, told the cable network on 11 October that decapitated bodies of babies had been found, and Biden seemed to confirm it at a roundtable event with Israeli leaders: \u201cI never really thought that I would see and have confirmed pictures of terrorists beheading children.\u201d While those dozens of beheadings may not have happened, Hamas undeniably was guilty of horrible crimes against children and babies as well as adults; and, in the other case, it is undeniable that the Israeli bombing campaign has hit many civilian targets and caused many Palestinian deaths. The fact-checking organization tracked the early reports back to a reporter for i24 News, an Israeli news channel, who said she was relaying the eyewitness reports of soldiers., Secondary trauma, also known as vicarious trauma, is a phenomenon where individuals experience symptoms of trauma as a result of witnessing or hearing about traumatic events happening to others, even if they aren\u2019t directly involved. It\u2019s not uncommon to feel helpless and overwhelmed at times like this, but if you find that secondary trauma is seriously affecting your mental health and daily life, consider speaking to a mental health professional. The line between being an informed and empathic global citizen and subjecting oneself to secondary trauma can be quite thin, and many of us find it difficult to turn away from the images flashing on our screens., Fourth, slowly weakening Hamas, as opposed to pounding it relentlessly and killing many more Palestinian civilians as a result, might reduce the chances of another front by Iran and Hezbollah opening up against the IDF in Lebanon or Syria. In lieu of a massive ground incursion, the IDF will seek to encircle and bleed Hamas until the threat it poses to Israeli population centres becomes negligible or manageable. For those who have been critical of Washington and its strong support of Israel in its military response, know that without Biden\u2019s political pressure, Israel might have gone all-in against Hamas., Then the aid agencies \u2013 UN, NGOs and Red Cross \u2013 can organise the thousands of workers, hundreds of trucks and thousands of tonnes of supplies needed in Gaza day after day, week after week for as far into the future as we can see. If we want to see an effective response from the international community, a good start would be a humanitarian resolution in the UN Security Council \u2013 just as has happened in previous Gaza crises,  . Aid agencies would like to see a ceasefire, but in the absence of one it is common for the combatants to agree arrangements \u2013 often involving the UN \u2013 to protect humanitarian work., These proxy wars, by the US in Ukraine and Russia in Syria, become more intractable when those allies have nothing but money to lose in fighting on, and status to lose in backing off. Sooner or later someone has to chart a route out of hell, when fighting on the ground has reached a stalemate and when the internal politics of the contending parties renders bilateral talks unthinkable. The host must be impartial in pushing the most difficult task of mediation, making the pain of compromise preferable to that of war., But as the war dragged on, European governments rose to the challenge And political unity in support of Ukraine has held despite setbacks, notably those created by Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Hungary.   on Russia, the hosting of millions of Ukrainian refugees, the victory over Moscow\u2019s attempt to weaponise Europe\u2019s energy dependence, and the sustained increase in military and economic assistance have been pillars of a concerted strategy. he outbreak of the worst violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for decades  triggered by Hamas\u2019 horrific attack on 7 October and Israel\u2019s disproportionate military response, marks a turning point in the unravelling of Europe\u2019s role in the world. Whereas some European leaders, such as Michel or the EU\u2019s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, have been clear in their messaging on Israel\u2019s legal obligations, others including Von der Leyen have been highly ambiguous,   within European institutions and beyond., One senior Labour party member described the resignation of Labour councillors in response to the party\u2019s position on Gaza as \u201cshaking off the fleas\u201d. I am told by a senior Labour insider that the Palestine issue is already being analysed solely in terms of which Muslim seats could swing away from Labour, and where wild card candidates can swoop in, campaign and win on this single issue, as George Galloway did in the past. However, I spoke to Azim Ahmed, the secretary general of the Muslim Council of Wales, and he told me of a community now even more angry at Labour, because of how the visit was instrumentalised; and of the resulting damage to the relationship between local party representatives and Westminster., But on 7 October, when death squads infiltrated  , massacred 1,400 people in their beds, on the streets and at a music festival; raped women; murdered and mutilated babies and young children; and kidnapped more than 200 people now hostage in Gaza, there are many who once again looked on, many who justified it and a distressing number who even celebrated it. The fact that Hamas murdered babies is irrelevant in this analysis, firmly grounded in the kind of discourse that talks only about \u201cpower\u201d, because the Jews have a state and because Israel is more powerful than the Palestinians. Grimly, it seems that for some, even murdered babies, toddlers or elderly people \u2013 dead Jews all \u2013 do not qualify for powerlessness, and therefore love, if they are Israeli., A member of the shadow cabinet who is close to the Labour leader observes that it is \u201ceasy for backbenchers and regional mayors\u201d to make \u201cnot credible\u201d demands for a ceasefire, but Sir Keir would look unserious as a candidate to be prime minister were he to follow suit. Sir Keir Starmer led his party in unequivocal denunciations of the atrocities, combined with unambiguous expressions of support for Israel as it reeled in horror at the single biggest act of antisemitic mass-murder on its soil since the Jewish state came into existence. A rising number of people in his party want Sir Keir to add his voice to the calls for an immediate and full cessation of military action, a demand dismissed by the Israelis as a denial of their right to attempt to \u201croot out\u201d Hamas., But in London and elsewhere in the UK, there are examples of protest crossing the line into antisemitism and active support for Hamas\u2019s atrocities: individuals   to their jackets after the terrorists who murdered and kidnapped young people at an Israeli dance festival, and carrying pro-Hamas placards. The Community Security Trust (CST), which collates reports of antisemitism in the UK and provides security advice and training for Jewish schools and synagogues, recorded at least   between 7 and 27 October; the highest ever recorded in a 21-day period, and more than those recorded during the first six months of this year. Incidents reported by the CST include a visibly Jewish man being taunted with threats of \u201ckill him\u201d on the London Underground, posters of Jewish men, women and children held hostage by Hamas being defaced or removed in London, Manchester and Leeds, and graffiti featuring swastikas., I understand why Palestinians fight for their freedom: Gazans languish in the world\u2019s largest open-air prison; Palestinians in the West Bank face violence from the Israeli state and far-right settlers, and are refused basic rights. A future where Palestinians and Israelis live side-by-side in relative peace is no easy road, but this only starts with the acknowledgement of an unbearable history: That Jews were failed time and again in the 19th and 20th centuries, left with no place to seek shelter from antisemitism. That despite the fact that Britain\u2019s promising of a land to the Jews not theirs to give away  , early Jewish settlers were far from their imperial soldiers, but a persecuted population failed by global governments pre and post Holocaust., Certainly, when student bodies debate whether or not Israel should be erased with annihilating intifada, older civilians may wonder if improvements like trigger warnings, no debate, safe spaces, sensitivity readers, a proper understanding of rolled eyes and other micro-aggressions, and the repeated exhortations to kindness learned from academic communities, always came with an unspoken exclusion where the feelings of Jewish people, of whatever affiliation, are concerned. So it\u2019s not obvious, even given the current horror and the (sporadically) heightened sensitivities characteristic of much academic life, what \u201cparallels\u201d (to quote the Cambridge University   Company, CUOS) between art and life were so obvious as to demand comprehensive community protection. \u201cWhilst it may seem Cambridge is a world away,\u201d wrote the director, cancelling a production of Handel\u2019s , \u201cthere are people who live in our colleges and households who are facing unimaginable difficulties as they watch the situation unfold.\u201d, You restore my faith in humanity \u2013 each time you march in our name and call for peace, each time you chant for a free Palestine and a better world, and with every sign, banner and flag that you wave in our support. It is the pictures of hundreds of thousands of people standing up for us and protesting in our name \u2013   in the streets of cities across the world, from Algiers and Istanbul to London and Washington DC. So my message to those people of Britain \u2013 who will stand up for us yet again today by attending peaceful demonstrations held in London and other cities\u2013 is a simple word of thanks., After Hindu-Muslim clashes in Leicester last year, local leaders pointed to inflammatory social media content \u2013 and its algorithmic amplification \u2013 as one of the main causes. In particular, young people in schools and elsewhere must be protected from discrimination and helped to avoid the kinds of polarisation and misinformation that are familiar from other conflicts, but have been supercharged by social media. Two Jewish schools were forced to close in the days after 7 October, and the Community Security Trust recorded   in just over four days., In order to maintain the international community\u2019s commitment to a future Palestinian state, there must be a cast-iron guarantee from the Israeli government that Palestinians who were forced to evacuate northern Gaza will be allowed to return when the war is over. Israelis and Palestinians need support from their friends abroad, and our own communities here in the UK that are affected by the conflict need reassurance as the Middle East conflict spreads to the streets of the UK. When this war is over, and casualties are counted, the only choice for the international community is to not only call for, but urgently work for a long-term solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict., Unable to drive France   and into a \u201c \u201d with Russia and Venezuela, M\u00e9lenchon coaxed the rest of the French left into falling in line behind him in an   \u2013 the Nupes. But while M\u00e9lenchon may have attracted many young voters to his campaign, he is no Bernie Sanders: his refusal to evolve from cold war-era reflexive anti-Americanism and his desire to pursue a \u201crevolutionary\u201d brand of opposition have dragged the French left into unelectability and moral confusion. In the midst of the backlash, M\u00e9lenchon has doubled down, lashing out at Glucksmann for voting for a European parliament   condemning the 7 October attack, while at the same time completely ignoring LFI deputy  , who called Hamas a \u201c \u201d days after the details of the massacre had become widely available., By Wednesday evening, Starmer had made his third U-turn (after an ITV interview, where he denied supporting Israel\u2019s right to cut off water and food; then an open letter to councillors stressing how much he felt the plight of Palestinians), to call for a \u201chumanitarian pause\u201d in bombing, which Sunak had already demanded some hours earlier. No matter that war is hardly the right noun for conflict between one of the most militarised states on Earth \u2013 Israel has 10 times more tanks than the British army \u2013 and Gaza, which has no planes, no Iron Dome (all-weather air defence system), barely any money. Last week, council leaders held a virtual meeting with the Labour leadership team, where, I\u2019m told, the greatest discontent came not from the party\u2019s metropolitan elite but  , including many stretches of the \u201cred wall\u201d with large Muslim electorates., There has just been a rare air attack on a suspected Hamas/Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) site in Jenin, but the IDF contribution in the West Bank has been much more of the order of intensive ground patrols. Given the utter determination of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government to destroy Hamas, many thousands more Palestinians will be killed and tens of thousands wounded. These, though, have been resisted and in one incident earlier in the year, one of the IDF\u2019s most modern armoured personnel carriers, designed specifically for use on the West Bank, was attacked and disabled in an attack near Jenin., This way Iran does not undermine Hamas\u2019s stature, but at the same time the invocation of Hezbollah places it as a stand-in for all Iran-backed militias in the Middle East \u2013 Hamas included \u2013 and therefore affirms Iran\u2019s position as their patron. ince 7 October, questions have been posed over whether Hezbollah would intervene in the fight against Israel in aid of Hamas, and on the extent of Iran\u2019s involvement in Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel. With Hezbollah being the better equipped of the two militant groups, there is a clear imperative for Hezbollah to let Hamas be the leading actor in this war so as not to detract from Hamas\u2019s pursuit of status., The world is indeed watching, as Biden said, and it knows, despite Biden\u2019s use of the Holocaust to distort what is clearly in front of our eyes, as more than 800 scholars of international law, conflict studies, and Holocaust and Genocide Studies declared in a   on 15 October: \u201cWe are compelled to sound the alarm about the possibility of the crime of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. More and more Holocaust and genocide studies scholars are refusing to allow the continuation of the dangerous use of the Holocaust to distort the historical reality of the Holocaust and Israeli mass violence against Palestinians. A powerful state, with powerful allies and a powerful army, engaged in a retaliatory attack against stateless Palestinians under Israeli-settler colonial rule, military occupation and siege, is thus portrayed as powerless Jews in a struggle against Nazis., The Israel and Palestine conflict is not fundamentally a Muslim or Jewish issue, it is a human rights issue, but the conflict disproportionately affects Muslims and Jews across the world and here in the UK, where people live in increasing fear of hate crimes and for our wellbeing and safety. In an   on 11 October, pressed on whether Israel\u2019s siege of Gaza \u2013 cutting off power and water \u2013 was appropriate, he said: \u201cI think that Israel does have that right, it is an ongoing situation. I was saying that Israel has the right to self-defence, and when I said that right I meant it was that right to self-defence., An online conversation between trauma therapists about supporting those in   rapidly attracted anger that the harms done to Israeli people were not noted in the post, which in turn prompted anger from those who felt the historical harms done to Palestinian people were disregarded by those who acknowledged the sadness and anger Jewish people felt. We usually only turn to psychology during conflict when dealing with the aftermath \u2013 PTSD, depression, anxiety, and addiction \u2013 but psychology can also explain the current dynamics in the world, especially through trauma literature. Israeli, Jewish, Palestinian, Arabic and Muslim people all carry severe historical traumas, and trauma-based reactions are thus magnified., Israel\u2019s deterrence posture must be reinforced \u2013 but Israel cannot deter a Hamas that, according to so many, wanted to incite this very reaction by Israel. Israel rules this state with force and apartheid-like measures \u2013 Gaza is governed by isolation, deprivation and violence, and the West Bank with a creeping annexation that imposes Jewish supremacy and the denial of basic rights to Palestinians. Israel has been willing to live with this status quo because, for Israeli extremists, it fulfills their ideological goal of a Greater Israel and, for the rest of Israeli society, because it does not significantly affect their lives., After all, when Tzipi Hotovely, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the UK,   for Israel\u2019s territory comprising the biblical territory of Judea and Samaria \u2013 that is, the annexation of the West Bank \u2013 she merely echoes Netanyahu\u2019s promoting a map of \u201c \u201d before the UN, which includes both Gaza and the West Bank. So let\u2019s hear from one such lawyer, Israel\u2019s former chief military advocate general and the country\u2019s former attorney general no less,   that to destroy Hamas \u201cthen you have to destroy Gaza, because everything in Gaza, almost every building there, is a stronghold of Hamas\u201d. Last week, the former foreign secretary Jack Straw conceded the Iraq war was \u201c  \u2013 I mean there\u2019s no question about that\u201d, with a casual tone more befitting someone who took the wrong turn off a motorway than someone who played a leading role in a war that killed hundreds of thousands of people., For decades, the United States has tried to pass itself off as an \u201chonest broker\u201d between Israel and the Palestinians, while at the same time supplying Israel with both its advanced weaponry and the political cover required during its continued encroachment on Palestinian territory. In the emergency Cairo summit of world leaders assembled to address the violence in Gaza and Israel, the best the British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, could come up with was to call for \u201cdiscipline and professionalism and restraint from the Israeli military\u201d. for South Africa at the Cairo summit, Ramaphosa called on \u201call state actors to desist also from providing weapons to either of the two sides to this conflict\u201d and for \u201ca United Nations-led negotiation process towards resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict\u201d., Maha remembers that I was not in Gaza during the last two wars in 2014 and 2021 and that I have never experienced war as a mother, so she elaborated: \u201cWe left our houses in the dark, ya Samiha. My mother died from a shortage of medical supplies and countless refused applications for Israeli military permits to travel out of Gaza for a scan. My mother-in-law is no longer in her kitchen in Gaza, cooking summakiya., The BBC is the issue because a strong, well-funded and editorially independent BBC has never been more important for an informed democracy than it is today. Our past calls in defence of the BBC\u2019s public broadcast legacy   by many, including David Attenborough, Lenny Henry, the late Hilary Mantel, and others who believe in the BBCs unique contribution to the cultural and social fabric of this country. We believe the BBC is the one British institution with the scale, global reach and editorial authority to create and protect this new and necessary, trusted digital public space., \u201cIsrael\u2019s bombardment and unlawful total blockade of Gaza mean that countless wounded and sick children, among many other civilians, will die for want of medical care,\u201d  . It\u2019s a failure of politics, collective security and international law, following on from the horrific Hamas atrocities of 7 October, which killed 1,400 people in Israel, including many children and infants. The mental health of children under 18, who comprise 47% of Gaza\u2019s 2.3m population (compared to 22% in the US and 33% in Israel), has been in crisis for years., Not only have   been stopped or broken up by police, the Berlin education senator Katharina G\u00fcnther-W\u00fcnsch has also   to schools saying that   \u201cany demonstrative behaviour or expression of opinion  (italics are mine) as approving the attacks against Israel or supporting the terrorist organisations that carry them out, such as Hamas or Hezbollah, represents a threat to school peace in the current situation and is prohibited\u201d. My family comes from Croatia, and as non-Croats we left the country during the nationalist frenzy of the early 1990s, which the late   as the fight for \u201cpure Croatian air\u201d Having been persecuted in Croatia since the early 1940s \u2013 my grandpa managed to leave the   alive at the age of 11 \u2013 we found ourselves in the north of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In addition to banning Hamas-related symbols schools are now free to also ban \u201csymbols, gestures and expressions of opinion that do not yet reach the limit of criminal liability\u201d, which includes the keffiyeh, the Palestinian flag and \u201cfree Palestine\u201d stickers and badges., Despite being a proud Palestinian who supports oppressed communities and actively speaks out against Israeli occupation and colonialism, this attack on Israeli civilians does not align with my beliefs \u2013 I condemn killing civilians and deeply mourn the loss of lives among Palestinians and Israelis. Supporting Palestine does not equate to antisemitism \u2013 advocating for ending Israeli aggression against Palestine doesn\u2019t imply forgetting the historical experiences and pain of the Jewish people. According to B\u2019Tselem, the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories: \u201cThe Israeli regime enacts in all the territory it controls an apartheid regime.\u201d, Kobi Shabtai, Israel\u2019s police chief, translated the policies of the hawkish and nationalist government into orders to the police force, and stated quite clearly that he will not tolerate any form of protest that is supportive of the people in the Gaza Strip: \u201c \u201d His boss, the minister of national security, Itamar Ben-Gvir,   warning all Jewish nationals about their Arab fellow citizens, as if he is not also their minister. For many Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel, who comprise 20% of our population, family members and loved ones in Gaza have been killed, injured or are still surviving horrifying living conditions. The Arab-Palestinian minority within Israel is at the same time part of the Palestinian people as well as citizens of Israel., But the ban was also politically ill-conceived, as it came after a   in Paris in support of Hamas\u2019s Israeli victims, attended by thousands of legitimately grief-stricken people. France\u2019s Human Rights League, the government\u2019s ban on demonstrations in support of the Palestinian cause constitutes \u201ca serious and disproportionate attack on the right to demonstrate\u201d. Indeed, the sudden global focus on the Israel-Palestine conflict since the extreme violence of 7 October exposes another kind of violence: that of the silence about and invisibility of the daily oppression faced by Palestinian civilians., But Labour risks being consumed by a furore over the position the party leader, Sir Keir Starmer, has taken over events in the Middle East. In Staffordshire\u2019s  , which registered one of the biggest leave votes in the Brexit referendum, the 23.9% swing from Conservative to Labour was the second highest in postwar byelection history. However, Sir Keir junked this approach when he was asked whether Israel was right to lay siege to Gaza \u2013 cutting off power and water \u2013 following Hamas\u2019s massacre of civilians., Prime minister for most of the last 15 years, Netanyahu has been an enabler of Hamas, building up the organisation, letting it rule Gaza unhindered \u2013 save for brief, periodic military operations against it \u2013 and allowing funds from its Gulf patrons to keep it flush. Netanyahu liked the idea of the Palestinians as a house divided \u2013 Fatah in the West Bank, Hamas in Gaza \u2013 because it allowed him to insist that there was no Palestinian partner he could do business with. Not for nothing did the scholar Hussein Ibish  : \u201cIn trying to fulfil the pledge to \u2018eliminate Hamas\u2019, Israel could well deliver everything Hamas is counting on.\u201d, Yet shit events happen (Harold Macmillan), and in light of the ones we are currently witnessing, we might cringe deeply at Sunak\u2019s apparent recent desire to go all-out for a Victoria Cross in the culture wars and expect to be thanked for his service. onsider the struggle of a modern statesman such as Rishi Sunak, forced to segue from   and state-mandated   to flying to the Middle East and saying something for the ages. Indeed, the strategy might be classified as micro-termist rather than short-termist, given the bag of tricks doesn\u2019t seem to have worked in either Tamworth or Mid-Bedfordshire, both of which byelections the Conservatives  , in seats that would once have been regarded as having unassailable Tory majorities., It is as if Shibli\u2019s German critics nest in a warm blanket of historical fantasy: they hang on to a vision of Israel\u2019s founding as an immaculate conception, one that has been refuted by any serious \u2013 Israeli or Palestinian \u2013 historian one can consult on the matter. A German, whose family is, like my own German family, implicated in historical atrocities, lecturing an Israeli about what moral or political lesson she may or may not derive from that very history was a grotesque sight to watch. Sign up to  The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion If Adania Shibli\u2019s case tells us one thing, it\u2019s that performative ignorance and avoidance on the issue of Israel-Palestine will not help us to dodge difficult questions about our own family histories for ever., The BBC\u2019s initial breaking news alert, simultaneously pinged to millions of phones via push notifications, said simply: \u201cHundreds feared dead or injured in Israeli airstrike on hospital in Gaza, Palestinian officials say\u201d, with a link to a more detailed report that many won\u2019t have clicked on. In the short time it took the Israeli government to check and then deny responsibility, blaming a misfiring rocket launched from within Gaza by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, the idea of Israeli guilt was halfway round the world. President Biden\u2019s summit with Arab leaders in Jordan was scrapped, Jewish communities around the world once again feared reprisal, and for several hours those closest to this conflict must have held their breath, wondering about potential repercussions for the Israeli hostages held captive in Gaza or Iran\u2019s appetite to escalate the conflict., Timo Andres Annie Baker Nico Baumbach Susan Bernofsky Judith Butler Michael Chabon Deborah Eisenberg Madeleine George Masha Gessen Francisco Goldman Andre Gregory Nan Goldin Alena Graedon Amy Herzog Marianne Hirsch Gabriel Kahane Cindy Klein David Klion Lisa Kron Rachel Kushner Tony Kushner Ben Lerner Jonathan Lethem Sam Lipsyte Zachary Lockman Kenneth Lonergan Andrew Marantz Ben Marcus David Naimon Benjamin Nugent Howard Rodman Dana Sachs Ira Sachs Lynne Sachs James Schamus Adam Shatz Wallace Shawn Leo Spitzer V (formerly known as Eve Ensler) Paula Vogel Ayelet Waldman Laura Wexler Hannah Zeavin We believe it is possible and necessary to condemn Hamas\u2019 attack and take a stand against the collective punishment of Gazans that is unfolding and accelerating as we write. As Jews, as Americans, we will be made to feel a sense of safety in our communities, and in the world, not by unequivocal US support for Israel, but by our government\u2019s insistence on the universal human rights that so many of us take for granted., Although Mr Biden spoke about Gaza\u2019s need for food, water and medicine, he said nothing about electricity and fuel, which Israel has also blocked, making hospitals all but impossible to keep open. Mr Biden\u2019s cancelled summit with Palestinian, Jordanian and Egyptian leaders, boycotted by the Arab leaders after the explosion at Gaza\u2019s al-Ahli Arab   this week, would have been an even more important one. The descant to Washington\u2019s support is its clear concern that overreaction by Israel would worsen the already severe suffering in Gaza, where at least 3,500 people have died, and escalate the conflict into a regional war into which others, including the US, risk being dragged., The Biden administration has been so committed to its normalization strategy \u2013 and the deliberate ignorance of Palestinian conditions \u2013 that it   for a Saudi-Israel deal even after the 7 October Hamas attacks and Israeli assault on Gaza. oe Biden flew to Israel on Wednesday to prove how deeply he and the US political establishment support Israel, even as it intensifies its indiscriminate bombing of Gaza, demands the forced displacement of more than 1 million Palestinians, and prepares for a ground invasion of the territory. To prove that he is a great friend to Israel ahead of his re-election campaign in 2024, Biden is risking a wider war in the region \u2013 one that could draw in Hezbollah, whose fighters are already skirmishing with Israeli troops along Lebanon\u2019s southern border; Palestinians in the West Bank; and possibly even Iran, which supports Hamas and Hezbollah., We do not know for sure   the al-Ahli Arab hospital, but the loss of at least 500 lives is either evidence that a heinous war crime has been committed through deliberate targeting of civilian infrastructure, or it is proof that in a place as densely populated as Gaza it is utterly impossible to minimise loss of civilian life. The UN estimates that people in Gaza now have access to an average of just 3 litres of water a day when a person needs 50-100 for basic health needs. According to the UN, at least six of Gaza\u2019s water wells, three water pumping stations and one water reservoir have been damaged so far., After showing condolences and sympathy, Biden \u2013 and any influential friend of Israel, for that matter \u2013 should really be focusing on three basic tasks: holding Israel to account for its own war crimes against Palestinians; reflecting on how those crimes contribute to the lack of security for Israelis themselves; and demanding that Israel go back to peace negotiations, this time ensuring equal footing for Palestinians in a way that would truly guarantee an end to apartheid. Living under a regime that local and international   and UN reports   \u201capartheid\u201d, Palestinians are treated as second-class citizens within Israel itself, are subjected to a racist and brutal military regime in the West Bank, and are suffocating in the world\u2019s largest open-air prison in the besieged Gaza Strip, which is also routinely bombarded by Israel. He wished to reaffirm his government\u2019s complete support for the Israeli government, to repeat the warning to surrounding states against intervening in the Israel-Gaza war, and to ask that his hosts offer some humanitarian relief for Palestinian civilians in the besieged Strip, which they continue to bomb intensely ahead of the planned ground invasion., grew up in the south of   with my parents and four siblings in a small village called Netiv Haasara, which is one of the closest Israeli villages to the Gaza Strip. Both my parents \u2013 my beloved wonderful parents, Yakov and Bilha Inon \u2013 are now dead. Swimming in the sea, picking oranges with my mother from the many orchards, running around in the wheat and corn fields my father helped to grow, picking wild mushrooms and looking for big snails in the winter \u2013 I have so many fond memories., I know plenty of people who are deeply engaged in politics, not (yet) despairing of British democracy, determined to vote at the next election, but who are also finding contact with news media distressing to the point of physical repellence. That isn\u2019t a claim of special sensitivity to the horror of what is happening in Israel and Gaza, just an explanation for why I find myself particularly torn right now between the duty to be informed and the impulse to recoil from the process of getting informed; and also why I crave meaningful arguments amid a frenzy of pointless ones. But right now, with waves of fear and fury radiating out of the  , it feels important to recognise a difference between communication that increases understanding and its opposite; between words used as tools to assemble meaningful propositions and words brandished as weapons and decoys., Biden will seek to persuade Israeli leaders to adopt rules of war that minimize civilian harm, but it\u2019s unclear how far Israel\u2019s government can or will go to protect civilian life for as long as it maintains its goal of destroying Hamas. Biden is betting that effusive public solidarity with Israel \u2013 a strategy the administration calls \u201c \u201d \u2013 will give him the credibility to influence the calculations of Israel\u2019s leaders in private. Another purpose of Biden\u2019s trip is to send a strong signal to Iran and groups such as Hezbollah that if they enter the conflict against Israel, they are likely to also find themselves fighting the United States., Even in the Middle East itself, Biden has paid more attention to Saudi Arabia and Iran than to Israel-Palestine. All this may help to explain why, since becoming president in 2021, Biden has been reluctant to spend political capital on an Israel-Palestine dispute that once absorbed so much US presidential time and effort. But the collapse of Biden\u2019s Amman meeting is a serious blow to this strategy, as is the widespread regional dismissal of Israel\u2019s denial of responsibility for the hospital attack., My own parents \u2013 who were visiting from their home, in Dundee \u2013 are trapped in the city of Deir al-Balah along with my brother, a doctor battling to care for injured civilians with dwindling medical supplies. I would really like to hear more from the UK government about the genuine facilitation of peace: not picking a side by saying \u201cI stand with Israel\u201d, which then encourages a carte-blanche approach to war against a people who are already under occupation, under siege. To have this narrative that the current conflict is Muslims against Jews, or Palestinian families against Israeli families, runs completely counter to that., Sunak will be aware that the Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, proclaimed: \u201cWe are fighting human animals\u201d as he ordered a \u201ccomplete siege\u201d of Gaza with \u201cno electricity, no food, no fuel\u201d, adding that Israel intends to \u201celiminate everything\u201d. This time, the UK stands \u201cunequivocally\u201d with Israel as it orders people in Gaza to flee their homes en masse,   as \u201cthe war crime of forcible transfer\u201d, while Francesca Albanese, the UN special raporteur on the Palestinian territories,  . As the horror mounts, Labour leaders issue feeble statements about how \u201cIsrael\u2019s defence must be in line with international law\u201d, when they know full well that it isn\u2019t, and that they helped offer a green light for this criminality., The war crime in this case is the damage to property: article 50 of the first Geneva convention, article 51 of the second Geneva convention and article 147 of the fourth Geneva convention. While the Israeli government could argue that instructing the people of Gaza City to leave is an attempt to protect them from bombardment, this directive might constitute a breach of article 17 of protocol II, forbidding the forced movement of civilians, and of article 49 of the fourth convention on deportations and evacuations. These crimes begin with the use of collective penalties against the people of Gaza (article 33 of the fourth convention and article 4 of protocol II)., But Hezbollah has indicated that it has  : the forcible displacement of large numbers of Palestinians outside Gaza \u2013 though Egypt has made it clear it does not want them \u2013 and a ground invasion aiming to destroy Hamas: Israel\u2019s stated intention. The US hopes two aircraft carrier groups in the eastern Mediterranean, non-stop shuttle diplomacy by the secretary of state and a presidential visit to Israel will see off the twin spectres of even greater humanitarian disaster in Gaza and regional catastrophe. Behind Hezbollah stands Iran; its foreign minister has   of \u201cmultiple fronts\u201d opening against Israel if it continues to kill civilians in Gaza., When I was 30, my friend Mahir\u2019s father died, and afterward Mahir generously walked my wife and me step by step through the Muslim rituals of mourning and burial; how he attended and washed and shrouded his father, then personally buried him in the earth. I think I am saying that Jewish and Muslim ghosts guided me better during my time of greatest pain than today\u2019s presidents and prime minsters and newspaper owners are guiding us today. When our son died, we had a beautiful template of intimacy to follow, thanks to the love of a Muslim son for his father., That tens of thousands did march for Gaza in London, and protesters gathered across the United Kingdom, the United States and other parts of the western world, sometimes risking arrest, merely to express support for the Palestinians illustrates precisely the kind of courage that is needed right now. Across the western world, our political leadership has decided that freedom of opinion must be curtailed, that expressions of support for Palestinians reflexively equate to support for   and terrorism, and that Palestinian narratives simply must be suppressed. At Brooklyn College, where I teach, the college president forced students protesting for Palestinian rights off campus, where they were met with a phalanx of police officers and a pro-Israel city councilwoman who   brandishing her own weapon., Despite Israel\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, saying it will \u201c \u201d in Gaza and speaking of removing \u201crestraints\u201d on his troops, despite reported plans to raze entire cities to the ground and to drive out   from their homes, scores of British politicians repeatedly and bluntly refused to show concern for Palestinian civilian lives. The legislation blocking civil society attempts to pressure Israel  , the legislation undermining the right to protest and Suella Braverman\u2019s   prior to the weekend demonstrations are all attempts to prevent ordinary people of conscience from acting in solidarity with the oppressed, the occupied and the colonised. This erasure of the occupation is surprising because Israel\u2019s is the longest military occupation in modern history, and recently the UN general assembly asked the international court of justice  ., It\u2019s a country where a Muslim mayor of London who has managed these last days with exemplary grace can break bread in a   in Golders Green one day and visit the London office of a   in Gaza\u2019s hospitals the next; where the wife of the Scottish first minister, Nadia El-Nakla, can speak emotionally of   for her parents\u2019 lives while introducing a motion to the SNP\u2019s conference that both unequivocally condemns the Hamas attacks and calls on Israel to respect international law in response. Already the British hard right is seizing on images of pro-Palestinian rallies across Europe, or diatribes by wannabe student politicians to proclaim the supposed grand failure of multiculturalism, or the idea that society is enriched by different groups being able to maintain their own religious and cultural traditions (within the confines of the law). Where mainstream critics of multiculturalism used to argue that there were better ways of living alongside each other in a pluralistic world, its new opponents bellow that no such world is possible; that mass immigration has broken the west, and that citizenship should be revoked from those already here if they express unacceptable views., Supported by Palestinian grassroots movements, unions and political parties that represent the absolute majority of Palestinians in historic Palestine and exile, BDS calls for ending international state, corporate and institutional complicity in Israel\u2019s regime of oppression so that the Palestinians can enjoy our UN-stipulated rights. In harmony with international law, the BDS movement has consistently defended the   of the Palestinian people to resist Israel\u2019s military occupation and colonization \u201cby all available means, including armed resistance,\u201d, as mandated by numerous UN resolutions, including   and  , with strict adherence to the prohibition against \u201ctargeting non-combatants\u201d. The fact that the occupied West Bank is under the partial control of the Palestinian Authority, which is implicated in \u201csecurity coordination\u201d with the Israeli occupation, has not saved Palestinians there from an ongoing Nakba of pogroms, extrajudicial killings, dispossession, annexation, illegal settlement construction, daily humiliation and denial of basic rights., It was only recently that Biden\u2019s frosty attitude to Israel thawed somewhat when he agreed to   \u2013 albeit not in the White House as the latter would have loved, but on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in New York \u2013 and granted Israel membership of his country\u2019s visa waiver programme after a very long wait. Well, Israel is indeed the US\u2019s business, to the extent that Washington provides it with military and other aid to the tune of  , supplying it with the most   and backing it diplomatically in international forums even on occasions when it might disagree with Israel\u2019s policies, or even actions that harm US interests. resident Biden\u2019s   to the murderous attack by Hamas on Israeli towns, villages and kibbutzim that claimed more than 1,200 Israeli lives, the majority of them civilians, was one of the most heartfelt expressions of support for Israel by a US president for a very long time., Iran is the \u201cstate actor\u201d that controls and coordinates the \u201cnon-state actors\u201d \u2013 Hamas and the militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza; Tehran-affiliated militias in Syria, Iraq and Yemen; and the most powerful of them all, Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah (the \u201cParty of God\u201d). Khamenei and Ebrahim Raisi, Iran\u2019s hardline president, sense weakness as they watch an Israel   by Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s anti-democratic, hard-right policies. he foremost concern of western governments as the Israel-Hamas war enters a murderous second week is not the plight of Palestinians in Gaza., With a   imminent, many Palestinians have fled their homes in response to Israel\u2019s demand that Palestinians in the north move south of the Wadi Gaza riverbed. Hamas should free the hostages \u2013 or face its leadership being wiped out at terrible human cost, as Israel will probably use more force than is needed to address its threat. Egypt,  , is being offered a debt write-off if it accepts refugees \u2013 risking Cairo being complicit in forcing Palestinians out of Gaza for good., Music is one way to bring people together \u2013 we are all equal human beings who deserve peace, freedom and happiness. Today, our musicians in the West-Eastern Divan and our students in the Barenboim-Said Academy are almost all directly affected by the conflict. We start and end all discussions, no matter how controversial, with the fundamental understanding that we are all equal human beings who deserve peace, freedom and happiness., To suggest that such butchery represents the Palestinian struggle is to demean the Palestinian people and their battle for freedom and rights, to view them in the same way as do those Israeli politicians and western commentators who talk of \u201canimals\u201d and \u201csavages\u201d. \u201cAnyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas,\u201d Netanyahu reportedly   in 2019. Not a liberal peacenik speaking from the safety of London or Washington but Yaakov Argamani, whose daughter Noa was taken hostage by Hamas at a   on Israel\u2019s border with Gaza., Allow the fallacious narrative that Zionists dropped out of a clear blue sky to occupy someone else\u2019s country, and you would still expect some inhalation of breath, some space for shock or sorrow, some admission that when they shouted, \u201cFrom the river to the sea, Palestine shall be free\u201d, even the most fervent anti-Zionists never envisaged freedom-taking in quite so bloody a form. But understand that the sight of Israelis who just happen to be Jews being manhandled into cars and driven away into captivity stirs memories of events that Jews hoped never to be caught up in again. And it\u2019s very likely that they taught their children from the cradle to despise all Jews, for that was no occasional, skin-deep animosity enacted in southern   last week., Necessary, too, is concerted international diplomatic pressure on Iran, on Hamas\u2019s political leaders in Doha to halt rocket and other attacks, and on their Qatari hosts to explain why they continue to allow the group to freely operate there. Protracted, street-by-street urban warfare against entrenched Hamas positions, booby traps and ambushes is a nightmare Israel\u2019s army has previously sought to avoid, principally because it is unlikely to succeed. The terrorist attacks by young Palestinians directed by Hamas in Gaza and trained and armed by Iran were an abomination for which there is no possible excuse., Underlying all this is another basic failure \u2013 the collective moral failure of the \u201cinternational community\u201d to enforce the laws of war, prevent collective punishments, respect the lives of civilians in conflict zones and abide by the UN charter and human rights treaties. . Yet even now this discredited leader is mobilising Israel\u2019s young people by the hundreds of thousands to fight a war his myopic misjudgments did so much to bring about. Now, once again, in  , the aggressive blundering of angry old men rains curses on the young, twisting minds, blighting lives, imperilling futures., Following the indictment, key members of Congress have been weighing whether to delay $235m in military aid to Cairo as punishment for Egypt\u2019s alleged involvement in this corruption and for Egypt\u2019s failure to demonstrate consistent progress in releasing detainees and improving its human rights record. If the charges against Senator Menendez are substantiated, it may partly explain why the Egyptian regime seemed so indifferent to America\u2019s previous threats: there were people working to get Egypt assistance without it needing to adhere to human rights commitments. In this context, the Egyptian regime has become proficient in speaking the disingenuous language of western countries, which use human rights issues to exert pressure on dictatorial governments in pursuit of their interests, spanning arms deals, economic issues, and global migration., I worked as a journalist in the region in the 1990s, and in recent years I have spent a great deal of time in Gaza and Israel, researching the history of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million refugees. As with Israel\u2019s expulsions in 1948, today\u2019s leadership will then project a narrative saying that there is no safe future for Israel unless the entire population of Gaza is permanently expelled. Since Israel and Egypt blockaded Gaza in 2006-7, cutting it off from the world, Israel has seen reason to hope that the story of 1948 would remain hidden, too., Unlike most communities in Israel, Kfar Aza lay within walking distance of the territory controlled by a terrorist group committed to killing all Jews and to the destruction of the world\u2019s only Jewish state. On the day we visited, Kfar Aza was an oasis of tranquillity, home to compassionate and peaceful people who just wanted to live their lives. Since   had taken control of the Gaza Strip, the people of Kfar Aza had lived under the constant threat of terror., Despite the paltry numbers, the interaction symbolised the same pro- or anti-Netanyahu breakdown that had caused Israel\u2019s political paralysis for four election cycles in a row \u2013 until a fifth poll finally yielded a fanatical, theocratic, proto-authoritarian government led by Netanyahu, despite his indictments on  .   The pro-Netanyahu camp is already insisting that the far right must be even more extreme, while the anti-Netanyahu camp finds it inconceivable that Netanyahu should remain in power after the catastrophe that has occurred on his watch. The Palestinian uprising of September 2000, known as the  , prompted a rise in the proportion of Israeli Jews who  , according to my survey research over the years; this was accelerated by Israel\u2019s unilateral withdrawal from Gaza, followed by Hamas\u2019s takeover in 2007., It cannot be OK that in the past week, a Jewish charity has recorded a 300% rise in   \u2013 a fourfold increase in abuse of one small minority group of British citizens. If we can only sweep our side of the street, then the people we choose as leaders are the street sweepers-in-chief, if you like \u2013 the people we entrust with making our corner of the world a better place. It is in these places, too, where Jewish populations are saying they are feeling more alone and more scared than they did last week \u2013 and in some cases less supported or less understood by people they thought were friends., My people are not weak, nor did they ever dismiss the ugliness of the injustices they endured; but even when enslaved people or persons claiming to care about the conditions of the enslaved used violence against innocent people, claiming it was for the cause of liberation, they said unequivocally: \u201cNo. We are not talking about slaves versus slave masters in Israel today, but I know from my own context that an unequivocal \u201cno\u201d to the actors within Hamas who chose to commit these heinous acts does not dismiss history and the oppression of Palestinian people when they have been beaten and harmed by the actions of some \u2013 not all \u2013 in Israel. Yes, the perpetrators of violence should face justice, just as some in Israel must be held accountable for its policies of violent apartheid against the Palestinian people (remember, many Israelis have and do oppose these policies, including some who were attacked last weekend)., Until last week, the Yom Kippur war, when Egypt and Syria launched an invasion from the south and north, was seen as the moment of Israel\u2019s maximum peril \u2013 but the despair, the dread, is even greater now, heightened yet further today when rocket sirens sounded across Israel\u2019s north. Given that, along with relentless airstrikes, Israel has already imposed a total siege on the strip, denying the 2 million Palestinians within food, fuel, electricity and water, it\u2019s no wonder the UN has   that such a mass movement of people will bring \u201cdevastating humanitarian consequences\u201d. But it was a pogrom that came to Israel last weekend, multiple pogroms in fact, as lethal as any that cut down the Yiddish-speaking Jews of the early last century or, in repeating patterns, the centuries before., The   of the review published by Rishi Sunak in March rows back a little by saying that a rules-based system is \u201cno longer sufficient\u201d but that Britain is keen to uphold international law. But the process of gradual but imperfect convergence around the universal rules set out after 1945 that seemed to accelerate in the early part of the post-cold-war era has now, in the era of Trump, Putin and Xi Jinping, gone into reverse. amas\u2019s murder of Jewish civilians in the Kfar Aza kibbutz on 7 October was \u201cwithout doubt a war crime\u201d, the BBC\u2019s Jeremy Bowen concluded in   from southern Israel this week., The EU \u2013 Israel\u2019s biggest trade partner and the Palestinians\u2019 biggest aid donor \u2013 has tried repeatedly to take a hand in Middle East peacemaking since 1980, when leaders of the then nine-nation European Economic Community adopted the   calling for the first time for Palestinian self-determination, and for the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to be associated with peace negotiations with Israel. At a minimum, that would mean taking decisions on foreign policy and sanctions by majority vote instead of requiring unanimity at each stage, and putting a single person \u2013 the \u201cforeign minister\u201d \u2013 in overall charge of foreign policy, humanitarian aid and financial and development assistance, including in the EU\u2019s \u201cneighbourhood\u201d. But she and the European Council president, Charles Michel, have waged a four-year tug-of-war for pre-eminence in foreign policy that has flared into occasional embarrassing public spats, such as in 2021 when the former Belgian prime minister  provided for visiting EU dignitaries by the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, leaving the former German defence minister to sit awkwardly on a nearby sofa., In one rendition, everything that occurred on 7 October owes to the Israeli occupation of Palestinians \u2013 the Gaza Strip, though under siege, isn\u2019t occupied by Israel, unlike the West Bank \u2013 and Hamas\u2019s attack was therefore righteous resistance against oppression. Yet despite the horrors the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam visited on Israeli civilians, Gazans are not animals, any more than are their counterparts in Israel. That Hamas also attacked Israeli soldiers and military bases is irrelevant: killing civilians was integral to their aim, not incidental or unintentional., On Monday, the EU commissioner Oliv\u00e9r V\u00e1rhelyi unexpectedly declared \u2013   \u2013 a freeze on EU development assistance to the Palestinians worth \u20ac690m. The scale of terror against Israel was \u201ca turning point\u201d, V\u00e1rhelyi wrote. The ultimate responsibility for further EU aid delivery lies with the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, who has a reputation for tight centralisation of power within the Brussels executive, but allowed a surprising degree of leeway to the Hungarian commissioner\u2019s freelancing. On the contrary, Israeli officials have always   international donors to continue the flow of aid to Palestinian territories, including to Gaza, because it effectively subsidises Israel\u2019s occupation and blockade, and has helped to ensure relative stability., Hamas seemed to offer the Israeli right the best of all worlds: relieving Israel of the need to govern the Gaza Strip, without making any peace offers that might dislocate Israeli control of the West Bank. Second, a coalition of the willing \u2013 ranging from the US and the EU to Saudi Arabia and the Palestinian Authority \u2013 should take responsibility for the Gaza Strip away from Hamas, rebuild Gaza and simultaneously completely disarm Hamas and demilitarise the Gaza Strip. The remnants of the Israeli left hoped that the Palestinians would make an honest attempt to turn Gaza into a prosperous and peaceful city state, a Middle Eastern Singapore, showing to the world and to the Israeli right what the Palestinians could do when given the opportunity to govern themselves., Israel\u2019s defence minister says that it is fighting \u201chuman animals\u201d; a defence spokesman   of emphasising \u201cdamage, not accuracy\u201d; a security official   that Gaza will be a \u201ccity of tents\u201d. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, and the European Union\u2019s foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, have rightly urged Israel to abide by humanitarian law. All the indications are that Mr Netanyahu will  , leading to many more Israeli and Palestinian deaths, and potentially wider escalation \u2013 a particular peril given regional power shifts drawing in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Iran., In fact these callous displays are a gift to militant Zionism, since they neatly shore up and reconfirm its core and governing belief: that the non-Jewish world hates Jews and always will \u2013 look, even the bleeding-heart left is making excuses for our killers and thinks that Jewish kids and old ladies deserved death merely by living in Israel. Harder for us adults is the fact that, in their desire to celebrate the powerful symbolism of Palestinians escaping the open air prison that is Gaza \u2014 which occupied people have every right to do \u2014 some of our supposed comrades on the left continue to minimize massacres of Israeli civilians, and in some extreme cases, even seem to celebrate them. Her latest book Doppelganger: A Trip into the Mirror World was published in September This article was edited at the request of the author to reflect the fact that celebrations of the deaths were rare, and many leading figures on the anti-colonial left, in Palestine and outside of it, clearly denounced the targeting of civilians., In Gaza, the Israeli military is reportedly   after such warnings \u2013 attacks that not only endanger any civilians who remain but also seem more designed to punish the civilian population than to target Hamas fighters who impose their will on the people of Gaza by force. The declared siege of Gaza, blocking food, water and electricity, violates the   to allow humanitarian aid to civilians in need, as the people of Gaza certainly are as they suffer massive Israeli bombardment. Yes, Palestinians were understandably frustrated as Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s far-right government kept expanding the   settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, boxing in the people of Gaza with a punitive blockade, and imposing an discriminatory and oppressive rule on millions of Palestinians under occupation that has been widely described as  ., One of the party\u2019s first reactions came from Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, who greeted news of the greatest atrocity in Israeli history by calling it a \u201c \u201d for Republican presidential candidates to criticize Democrats. If the party recognizes the unfolding horror primarily as a \u201cgreat opportunity\u201d to hammer the Democrats, then that opportunity can be maximized by making it as difficult as possible for the Biden administration to respond effectively. Perhaps most disgusting and divisive has been the spectacle of Republicans telling outright lies in order to claim that the Biden administration is directly \u201c \u201d in the attack, as Senator Tim Scott has claimed., At Medical Aid for Palestinians, we have released all our pre-positioned stocks of medical supplies to hospitals, as health services have been overwhelmed by the huge influx of injuries. As of Monday, Israel has imposed a   on Gaza \u2013 effectively a siege, restricting the entry of fuel, electricity, and even food and water \u2013 despite its obligations under international law. People fear the worst is yet to come, given the support Israel is receiving from its western allies, without consideration or concern for basic humanitarian principles or international law., A friend\u2019s uncle hiding under a capsized boat; a friend\u2019s friend listened over the phone as her sister\u2019s family was murdered; a friend\u2019s nephew killed at a rave, a cousin\u2019s daughter escaped the same rave by the skin of her teeth. The only thing that comes to my mind are the words of French,Jewish philosopher Emmanuel Levinas, which I came across in my research into communication with the \u201cother\u201d, whether through laughter or any other embodiment of experience: \u201cThe face of the other in its precariousness and defencelessness is for me at once the temptation to kill and the call for peace, the \u2018thou shall not kill\u2019.\u201d Maya pulled a face and waved her hand dismissively but then, almost automatically, got up and led the way to the \u201csafe space\u201d on the stairs, where my family, with the other neighbours in the eight-floor building, gathered, and we waited for the explosion sound that told us we could go back to the flat., \u201cSocial media companies, particularly those that style themselves forums for free speech, have a moral obligation to try to ensure the free flow of reliable information to desperate users facing mortal risk,\u201d said Suzanne Nossel, chief executive of PEN America, which advocates for free expression. As Hamas announced that it intends to begin killing civilian hostages and broadcasting executions in audio and video, Clara Jeffery, editor-in-chief of Mother Jones, foresaw more trouble: \u201cI want everyone to realize that Elon has set up his site so that these snuff videos will be monetized for his blue checks.\u201d Not long after buying Twitter, Musk got rid of most of the Twitter content moderation staff that had tried to keep things as accurate as possible by flagging fake accounts and attaching warnings., Last weekend, such viral posts included Algerian firework celebrations being   on Hamas,   being presented as a Hamas attack, years-old videos from the Syrian conflict cast as   on Tel Aviv airport, and an entirely   holding the Palestinian flag posted by an account that poses as a blue-tick BBC journalist. The channel\u2019s offering was an eclectic mix of neuron-slaughtering dross, to put it kindly, including Topless Darts, the News Bunny \u2013 a giant rabbit who stood behind the newsreader and emoted according to the story being read out \u2013 and Tiffani\u2019s Big City Tips, wherein a model stripped to her underwear while telling you where to invest (in rival telly companies, would seem to be the short answer). Just 11 million people had viewed Musk\u2019s post before he took it down and posted again, this time adopting arguably the worst Musk tone \u2013 fake responsibility., Apparently, the freshman senator forgot that the US supreme court\u2019s decision in Dobbs gutting abortion rights cost the Republican party control of the Senate and turned a much-anticipated \u201cred wave\u201d in the House into a trickle, leaving McCarthy to suffer at the hands of Matt Gaetz and his fellow arsonists. Unlike Benny Gantz, Israel\u2019s former defense minister and the head of an opposition party, Netanyahu has not yet been to the White House. In California\u2019s Senate race, Congressman Adam Schiff is   of the three leading Democratic candidates to voice unambiguous support for Israel., In its place is unequivocal support for Israel, even as Israel\u2019s defense minister announces his intention to impose a total siege of Gaza in which no electricity, food or water would get in, and as Israeli warplanes fire US-made missiles that collapse residential buildings and kill entire Palestinian families. Noura Erakat is an associate professor at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, and the author of Justice for Some: Law and the Question of Palestine Since the United States\u2019 announcement of unconditional support and emergency military and other assistance to Israel, Israeli officials declared Palestinians \u201chuman animals\u201d and proclaimed their intention to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity, if not an act of genocide. Israel has subjected Palestinians to settler-colonial removal for 75 years, to the longest occupation in history for 56 years, and to a debilitating siege of Gaza holding 2.2 million Palestinians in an open-air prison for 16 years., As of Monday, the ministry of health in Gaza reported about 700 Palestinians killed by Israeli airstrikes and also thousands injured, with an additional 15 lives lost in the West Bank. The attack was immediately followed by the imposition of a full lockdown, which tightens the grip on the daily lives of the West Bank\u2019s residents, restricting our movements and intensifying the limitations on access to essential services and resources. Images of the torment and brutal killings of hundreds of   bring back memories of the violence and humiliation suffered by Palestinians, including children, women, elderly and disabled people, over many years., The intelligence system, which surveils every aspect of Palestinians\u2019 lives in Gaza and the West Bank, had no prior knowledge of the attack; civilians were left defenceless for many hours against Hamas militants, who trapped them in their homes and   without military intervention \u2013 the same military tasked with protecting every settler in the West Bank at any given moment. On Saturday night, after hours of anxious staring at the television and social media, my daughter was panicked by the fear that Hamas militants, armed and still inside Israeli territory, might make their way to Jerusalem and attack us in our home. Terrible crimes were committed against Israelis this Saturday, crimes that the mind cannot fathom \u2013 and in this time of dark grief, I cling to the one thing I have left to hold on to: my humanity., If Joe Biden wants to rescue Israel-Saudi normalisation and the exclusionary  , if the US and Europe want to prevent a wider war drawing in Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iranian-backed, anti-Israel militias in Syria and Iraq, if the western democracies want to keep Russia (and China) from further extending regional influence, they must end the hands-off approach to the Palestinian question that has effectively empowered hardliners on all sides. Informal talks have already begun about establishing a national unity government to confront Israel\u2019s worst crisis since the 1973 Yom Kippur war \u2013 what its UN ambassador calls \u201cIsrael\u2019s 9/11\u201d. \u201cThe prime minister, who has prided himself on his vast political experience and irreplaceable wisdom in security matters, completely failed to identify the dangers he was consciously leading Israel into when establishing a government of annexation and dispossession,\u201d an editorial in the left-leaning Haaretz newspaper  ., The horrifying pogroms Azerbaijanis committed against the Armenians in our major cities were denied, minimised or explained away as being organised by the Armenians to make themselves look like victims, garner international sympathy and justify starting a war of occupation. Concentric circles of alternating ethnicities radiated outward from Shusha; Azerbaijanis surrounded by Armenians surrounded by Azerbaijanis and Azerbaijani Kurds and so on \u2013 a great inconvenience for emerging nationalist narratives. Before the first war, inside Azerbaijan\u2019s borders there existed the \u201cNagorno-Karabakh autonomous oblast\u201d, a majority-Armenian island, so to speak, of mountainous land, with the culturally significant, majority-Azerbaijani citadel   right in the middle., A   is no fix for the political crisis begat by a moribund Palestinian leadership which lacks both power and legitimacy \u2013 and, above all, by Mr Netanyahu, who has overseen massive settlement expansion, handed extreme nationalists and overt racists not only a veneer of respectability but key positions, and promised annexation. Israel Defence Forces raids have soared; this summer saw the   on the West Bank in two decades. Just over a week ago, President Biden\u2019s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan,  : \u201cThe Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades.\u201d, His re-election   will in effect be launched this week, when India, the hosts of the cricket World Cup, take on arch-rivals Pakistan. If the team are crowned one-day world cricket champions this year, Mr Modi may be   to call an early poll to capitalise on the celebratory fervour. The country stunned professional golf when its LIV Golf vehicle said it would   $1bn to merge with the PGA \u2013 despite the latter\u2019s   over Saudi Arabia\u2019s use of torture, imprisoning political activists and history of enforced disappearances., For the extreme right in Israel, this is also an opportunity to escalate tensions between Israel and the West Bank, the other Palestinian territory between the west bank of the River Jordan and the eastern frontier of Israel, as members of the Knesset openly speak about large-scale expulsion of Palestinians as a desired outcome. While Netanyahu agreed to some easing of pressure on Gaza, he was unwilling to accept Hamas\u2019s long-term demands, including a large-scale prisoner swap, lifting the siege by opening the international border crossing, and establishing a port and airport in Gaza. Israel had rebuffed Egypt\u2019s earlier offers for a negotiated withdrawal from Sinai, and the Egyptian president, Anwar Sadat, believed that a limited military achievement would shift the balance of power and bring Israel to the negotiating table., In July, the European Union   an agreement promising a substantial cheque to Tunisia\u2019s authoritarian leader, Kais Saied, in exchange for a crackdown on irregular migrants seeking to cross the Mediterranean to Italy. Nevertheless, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, flanked by Giorgia Meloni, Italy\u2019s radical-right prime minister, and Mark Rutte, the Netherlands\u2019 outgoing leader, have seen fit to employ him as a kind of border guard. In neighbouring Libya, where an EU-sponsored cooperation agreement was signed six years ago, detained migrants have been routinely   to rape, beatings, extortion and collective expulsion., In February 2021, a month after taking office, Biden did follow through on a campaign promise to release a long-delayed  , which directly blamed Prince Mohammed for Khashoggi\u2019s murder, noting that since 2017, he \u201chas had absolute control of the kingdom\u2019s security and intelligence organizations, making it highly unlikely that Saudi officials would have carried out an operation of this nature without the Crown Prince\u2019s authorization\u201d. Unlike Biden, Trump and senior members of his administration never wavered in their support for Prince Mohammed and the Saudi regime, even as the international outcry over Khashoggi\u2019s killing intensified. Prince Mohammed not only humiliated Biden but showed that he is in a stronger position today \u2013 and has more international suitors looking to curry his favor and win Saudi investments \u2013 than five years ago when he ordered Khashoggi\u2019s assassination., Yet a new report from Human Rights Watch   that the US government has apparently failed to compensate or provide other redress for victims tortured and abused at Abu Ghraib and other US-run prisons in Iraq, and that there is no clear path to pursuing claims. Taleb al-Majli told Human Rights Watch that his detention and torture at Abu Ghraib \u201cdestroyed me and destroyed my family \u2026 They stole our future from us.\u201d In other regards, it reflected what happened across US military detention centres and CIA \u201cblack sites\u201d, as the treatment meted out to \u201cunlawful combatants\u201d held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay migrated to Afghanistan and Iraq., His son Saddam has been   of the disaster response committee; the international community will be coordinating with a man whose forces took \u201csubstantial quantities\u201d of cash and silver belonging to the central bank, according to  , and have carried out a \u201ccatalogue of horrors\u201d, including war crimes,   Amnesty International. The paper\u2019s authors, Dr Renad Mansour, Tim Eaton and Dr Lina Khatib, argue that such deals have reduced direct violence, but overlooked structural forms of violence and have failed to improve, or even worsened, corruption and human development scores. \u201cThose people are not numbers at all \u2026 Those people are love stories, friendships, dreams, ambitions ... are people who had names,\u201d Johr Ali, a journalist from the city,   the Guardian\u2019s Today in Focus podcast., Storm Daniel is a natural disaster,   Elham Saudi, the director of Lawyers for Justice in Libya, but the ensuing catastrophe \u201cis manmade: corruption; lack of infrastructure; impunity; shutting down frontliners in civil society \u2026 Be angry at a system that has enabled this tragedy.\u201d The horror and despair of Libyans is matched by their fury at the rival governments that have split the country and pursued power and profit while ignoring the people\u2019s needs. Key figures in civil society, precisely the people who might mobilise relief efforts, languish in jail while their compatriots need them., It is the apogee of a remodelled Cairo that already rings the city as it expands into compounds, villas and entire new neighbourhoods, linked via new highways, that increasingly house Cairo\u2019s large middle-class population. \u201cThe Egyptian state has always wanted to control histories,\u201d he says, but in more recent times, there has been what appears to be a \u201cdeliberate targeting\u201d in which \u201cthe attempts to erase history are part and parcel of attempts to overwrite people\u2019s claims to property rights over what are clearly historic plots of valuable real estate\u201d. But with that, history, antiquity, green spaces and people\u2019s rights to land and memories are being sacrificed, as the soul of the city itself seems to decamp towards the new buildings on its outskirts., And the Chipkos\u2019 actions to protect the forests on which they depended for their livelihoods  , when hundreds of women in the northern Indian state shielded trees with their bodies to stop them being felled, just as the women of Akbelen are doing today. From student campaigners in major cities to traditional matriarchs in rural societies, women will increasingly be at the heart of the next chapter in the fight against the climate crisis and the protection of the land and the water. The resistance in Akbelen is supported by large segments of Turkish society, but those leading the movement are local villagers, especially village women., After rebel groups angered by the marginalisation of the non-Arab population took up arms, the dictator Omar al-Bashir sought to terrorise the region into compliance by outsourcing ethnic cleansing to the Janjaweed militia.  , known as  , rose through the ranks and then oversaw the regularisation of the fighters into the RSF. hen fighting erupted in Khartoum four months ago, the immediate horror at its impact on civilians was shadowed by a still greater fear \u2013 that the conflict between two warring generals might swiftly spread through the rest of  , causing still more suffering, destabilising neighbours and, in particular, sparking fresh ethnic violence in Darfur. Human rights groups say both the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the paramilitaries battling the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), and allied Arab militias are preying on members of the Masalit minority., Israel is giving a gift to its enemies in the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement and its allies, especially in South Africa, where denial of Israel\u2019s existence is intense among many black people, in trade unions and communist and Muslim circles. I write about South Africa and Israel because I know both of them, 53 years in one and nearly 26 years in the other. In Israel, the ultra-Orthodox have joined forces with Likud and religious nationalists to secure unlimited money for their separate schools, to keep their children out of the army and to impose their religious dictates on the entire country., f you want proof Saudi Arabia is trying to improve its reputation, visit the website of the Saudi Tourism Authority. The majority owner of the news organisations, Evgeny Lebedev, sold a 30% stake in both in 2017 and 2018 to offshore companies fronted by a Saudi businessman, Sultan Muhammad Abuljadayel  The Standard and the Independent have stated they are unsure of who funds the businessman. It\u2019s mind-boggling to think that in 2018 the world was spitting with rage as gruesome details emerged of the   and Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi, a crime the CIA concluded was ordered by the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman., It was not only the end of the hope for supporters of the deposed government of the Muslim Brotherhood, and for others still committed to the principle of civilian leadership despite the growing authoritarianism of president Mohamed Morsi, ousted by Gen Sisi. en years ago this week, having recently seized power in a coup, Gen Abdel Fatah al-Sisi commanded police and troops to crack down on mostly unarmed demonstrators in central Cairo. Rishi Sunak gave Gen Sisi the photo opportunity he wanted with a handshake at last year\u2019s Cop27 conference in Egypt, while the activist was close to death due to a hunger strike., Charles de Gaulle, France\u2019s most influential postwar president, summed up its importance by saying: \u201cFrench world power and French power in Africa were inextricably linked and mutually confirming.\u201d If \u2013 as seems likely \u2013 hatred of France intensifies, then there is every possibility of full-blown evacuations, to include French soldiers, as the key Fran\u00e7afrique nations of sub-Saharan Africa finally complete the decolonisation process. Troops working for Wagner, the Russian mercenary group, are meanwhile operating within Niger\u2019s neighbours, and have   to the rebellious Nigeriens.  were brandished by those demonstrating outside the French embassy in Niamey, with many calling for Vladimir Putin to replace Macron as their biggest global backer., David Beckham, another former England captain, spent the last minutes of his career on the pitch in tears, but even by that point he had spent years being more commercial product than footballer \u2013 CEO of Brand Beckham rather than the boy with the magic right foot. Michael Jordan may have immortalised his triumphant \u201clast dance\u201d with the Chicago Bulls in the form of a  , but his first retirement from basketball later involved a tragi-comic attempt to become a baseball player and his final retirement petered out in a Washington Wizards jersey, losing to the Philadelphia 76ers. In Moeen Ali and Stuart Broad, two long-serving cricket warriors going into battle one last time and landing decisive blows to claim the victory, that writer had their ideal protagonists., If you squint, you can still just about make out, through the continued existence of the football \u201cpyramid\u201d in particular, some meaningful connection between elite European soccer as a global entertainment product and the industrial communities that created the game as a working-class pastime and collectively developed it through a gradual, layered process over multiple generations into a permanent feature of popular culture alongside things like music, TV and film. Accelerating in the early 1990s, the successful commercialisation and marketisation to global TV audiences of a small number of powerful leagues led to an increased concentration of talent in England, Spain and Italy, directly at the expense of \u201csmaller\u201d leagues, which were turned into relative backwaters. If there is comfort to be drawn from the experience of football\u2019s past several decades, it is the limitless capacity of supporters to derive pleasure from the game and use it as the basis for meaningful connections with others \u2013 no matter how shamelessly wealthy interests have sought to exploit and co-opt our affection and enthusiasm., Supporters of the judicial overhaul \u2013 who, by all polls, are only a minority of the furthest rightwing Israelis \u2013 hope the government will now have unfettered power to annex the West Bank, expand settlements, deepen the hold of strict Jewish religious observance in Israeli life and reinstate corrupt politicians, especially one who had been ousted when the court ruled his appointment \u201cextremely unreasonable\u201d \u2013 the very legal reasoning that last week\u2019s legislation will stifle. Pro-democracy supporters will have to face uncomfortable truths about how undemocratic Israel has been for most of its history \u2013 from the military government that ruled its own Arab citizens in the first 20 years to the occupation authorities governing Palestinians which took over where the first military regime left off. Our train arrived at the tail end of a massive rightwing demonstration in Tel Aviv, with people who also flooded in from around the country and the West Bank, to   the government\u2019s plans., Thanks to the law passed this week, that could mean an attempt either to sack the attorney general or strip her of authority over prosecutions, clearing the way for a new, more sympathetic official who might \u2013 purely coincidentally, you understand \u2013 decide to review existing cases, before concluding that all charges against Netanyahu should be dropped and the trial halted. Polish and Hungarian campaigners recognise in Netanyahu\u2019s drive to turn Israel into an illiberal democracy the transformation wreaked in their own countries. In other words, despite massive economic and civil disruption and a mutiny that military officials warn has seriously degraded Israel\u2019s ability to defend itself, Netanyahu went ahead anyway., Their political parties are the bulwarks of the government: Religious Zionism, which   an ideology of Jewish supremacy, and United Torah Judaism, which wants the ultra-Orthodox way of life undisturbed and subsidised. The   allies of Mr Netanyahu have been growing in political significance due to the unchecked expansion of illegal settlements in the occupied territories and the sharply rising ultra-Orthodox population. Israel\u2019s social contract has already been broken in part by rising  : a fifth of Israelis live below the national poverty line, but so do almost half of the ultra-Orthodox \u2013 and a third of Arab Israelis., How refreshing it was to see that torrent of people slowly pouring down the hillside outside Jerusalem, composed of hundreds of thousands of Israelis of all ethnicities and all ages, supporters of different political parties, people who founded \u2013 or whose foremothers and forefathers founded \u2013 the state, and who will absolutely not give up on their dream. As if the awareness that has been dulled for so many years has suddenly been awakened, we now comprehend the responsibility \u2013 no, the culpability \u2013 of the self-proclaimed agents of Jewish history who brought about the state\u2019s greatest disaster: the settlement enterprise. The deception perpetrated by Simcha Rothman (member of the Knesset for the far-right Religious Zionist party), the justice minister,  , the security minister,   and Benjamin Netanyahu is, ultimately, just the artist\u2019s signature in the corner of the big picture., The Henderson controversy shows how the wealth of the Gulf states, and of Saudi Arabia in particular, is reshaping the sporting landscape and raising new questions about the relationship between sport and politics. According to the Campaign Against Arms Trade, since the start of the Saudi attack on Yemen, there has been almost   worth of arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Taking off the MBS-crafted designer blinkers, though, what we can see in Saudi Arabia is minor social reform undergirded by continuing political despotism and the crushing of any dissent., It has apparently used the US messaging app Snapchat to  , as the Guardian reported this week, while imposing draconian sentences on influencers who use social media to post any criticism of the future king, including a Leeds PhD student,  . The UK has now invited Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince and de facto leader, Mohammed bin Salman, whom the CIA believe   despite his denials,  . Some analysts have suggested that Prince Mohammed has learned his lesson in the light of the international backlash over Mr Khashoggi\u2019s murder, and is pursuing a more moderate path., When Herzog pledged to overcome Labor\u2019s reputation as \u201cArab lovers\u201d, Ayman Odeh, leader of the largely Palestinian Joint List,   him to stop acting like a \u201ccheap and pale imitation of Netanyahu\u201d and instead \u201cpresent a real and brave alternative to the government of Netanyahu and the right\u201d, based on \u201cequality and democracy and \u2026 a common fight for the future of us all\u201d. Unlike Netanyahu, Herzog has a long history of at least theoretically supporting a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, which would grant citizenship to the millions of Palestinians who now live as stateless subjects under Israeli control. The tragedy of Herzog\u2019s career is that during his time atop the Labor party, prominent Palestinian citizens implored him to stop aping the racist right and instead bring Palestinians and Jews together in a struggle for equality., Nato joy was also tempered by the belated realisation that Erdo\u011fan\u2019s unexpected summit geniality   with Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, with whom he maintains friendly relations for pragmatic reasons of national and personal self-interest. The trigger was the apparent decision by Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Turkey\u2019s president, to   on Nato membership for Sweden which, when last checked, was not being bombarded by Russia. Coinciding with Turkey\u2019s   placed in its custody by Russia and some   between Erdo\u011fan, the EU and Ankara\u2019s old enemy, Greece, all the talk was of a sudden, pro-western tilt by the notoriously unbiddable Turkish leader., So, in summary, here we had a counterfeit Saudi Arabian football shirt, doubtless made at all but zero cost in China or thereabouts, now on sale on a market stall in central Europe. The football strips included plenty of Croatian national team shirts, plus those of clubs with Croatian players: Modri\u0107\u2019s name printed on Real Madrid shirts, Peri\u0161i\u0107\u2019s on Tottenham\u2019s, Kova\u010di\u0107\u2019s at Chelsea and so on. We have to assume that a criminal mastermind somewhere heard the news that Ronaldo had signed for Al Nassr and that the vast amount of money paid would be recouped in shirt sales., When a settler group rampaged through Huwara in revenge for a Palestinian gun attack, torching homes and cars in what an Israeli general called a  , Bezalel Smotrich, the   who also oversees settler life in the West Bank, said the village  . While the UN humanitarian office expressed concern at the scale of the operation, including airstrikes on an area densely populated with civilians, the US merely said that it supported Israel\u2019s security and right to defend its people. srael has portrayed its strikes on the Jenin refugee camp \u2013 the biggest military operation in the occupied West Bank for two decades \u2013 as a limited intervention  ., Sure enough, the resulting power vacuum has been filled by local West Bank groups of young militants, exemplified by the so-called Jenin brigades, pursuing armed resistance for lack of a credible political process. he endlessly simmering conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, exploding into   this week in the embattled West Bank city of Jenin, threatens a broader, more far-reaching catastrophe. Parliamentary support from national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, finance minister Bezalel Smotrich and their allies keeps Netanyahu in office.  , The hajj pilgrimage is, at its core, a pilgrimage towards God. We need to find it focused on a particular place and, for the Muslim, that place is the Ka\u2019ba at Mecca, which he has faced every time he prayed and to which he now journeys in pilgrimage. The Covid pandemic saw pilgrimage to the holy sites halted for two years, with only  permitted to perform the pilgrimage., Yet proposed legislation now  , the  , attempts \u201cto prevent public bodies from being influenced by political or moral disapproval of foreign states when taking certain economic decisions\u201d \u2013 even when the censured conduct is a breach of international law. The bill would allow ministers to rule that particular countries or territories do not come under the legislation \u2013 except in the case of Israel, the occupied Palestinian territories, or the occupied Golan Heights. But legitimate criticism of illegal settlements and an increasingly extreme far right Israeli government must not be silenced, and economic sanctions are a reasonable means of expressing dissent., This argument may be extended further, to include people from other neglected, post-colonial countries in the Horn of Africa, the Sahel and South Asia, whose sense of hopelessness, impoverishment and chronic insecurity fuels migration. The west\u2019s failure to stop the Syrian regime\u2019s war on its people led to the 2015-16 migrant crisis, when hundreds of thousands of Syrians sought safety in Europe. European countries, including Britain, have persistently failed to develop a humane, coherent and effective approach to the challenges posed by irregular migration., The Saudi sovereign wealth fund PIF has essentially bought professional golf, taking over the PGA Tour by merging it with LIV, a new, smaller competition golf series that Saudi Arabia launched in 2021. These are justified concerns: Saudi Arabia\u2019s image problem has intensified under its leader, Mohammed bin Salman, who brought the nation into global disrepute with the grisly murder of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a crackdown on political opposition and the ramping up of capital punishment. On the campaign trail in 2019, Joe Biden   that Saudi Arabia would be punished for its murder of Khashoggi, and for the brutal war in Yemen, pledging to end the sale of materiel to the Saudis \u201cwhere they\u2019re going in and murdering children\u201d., From the EU\u2019s 2010  ; to its subsequent agreements with militias and warlords after western intervention had shattered Libya; to the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa set up in November 2015 as the Syrian war caused a sharp peak in migrants and panic in European capitals; to the Khartoum Process, which drew in countries in the east of Africa, including Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan and South Sudan; to bilateral deals with countries such as Turkey and Niger \u2013 the EU has disbursed billions of euros in an effort to persuade non-European countries to act as its immigration police. It is, in per capita terms, the largest recipient of EU aid, in return for which the Niger authorities are forced to distort domestic policies to fit with the EU\u2019s migration needs, including the adoption in 2015 of a law against smuggling migrants. The Brussels-enforced policy has not only acted as a block to Europe-bound migration but destroyed regional migration and made freedom of movement, that hallowed policy within the EU, much more difficult within Niger., Because imagining Tunisia without this or that side, Tunisia without Ennahdha, Tunisia without political Islam, without the Left, without any of its components, is a civil war project. Snaps of him standing alongside al-Assad and Egypt\u2019s Abdel Fatah al-Sisi during the summit were widely shared around the region, signalling Tunisia\u2019s return to the grand old club of Arab dictatorships. Since the era of the Arab spring, which in Tunisia saw Ben Ali deposed, the country has resisted the dark fates of its sisters such as Egypt, Yemen, Libya or Syria., As the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has  , Mr Erdo\u011fan won in elections that were free but not fair; the president controls the vast majority of Turkish media, while political opponents have been harried and, in some cases, jailed. As Mr Erdo\u011fan embarks on a record third decade in power with a conservative and nationalist mandate \u2013 and with increasingly authoritarian powers to enforce it \u2013 millions of other Turkish residents also have good grounds to disbelieve his sunny rhetoric. As the Turkish lira sinks to a new record low following Mr Erdo\u011fan\u2019s re-election, the need to alleviate the deepening economic crisis may create new opportunities for negotiation and rapprochement., The Free Cause party is closely affiliated with Kurdish Hezbollah, a Sunni militant group that originated in the Turkish south-east and gained notoriety in the 1990s when its members tortured and killed hundreds of Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) members and supporters, as well as others who opposed its ideology, though it has since officially renounced violence. Ahead of the runoff elections, the women\u2019s rights group Left Feminist Movement warned that the choice between Erdo\u011fan and K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu was one between \u201cdarkness\u201d and \u201clight\u201d. Last year, bogus charges of \u201cacting against morality\u201d   against We Will Stop Femicide, a feminist platform that fights gender-based violence and keeps a monthly count of murdered women., The longer the war drags on, the greater the risk that more people will be drawn into this conflict: other domestic armed groups, civilians who begin to see no other way of defending their communities, and regional players pursuing their own interests. This speaks to the disregard shown to those caught up in the struggle between two generals: Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Sudan\u2019s army chief and de facto leader, and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as  , who commands the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. hen foreign diplomats fled   as fighting engulfed Khartoum, some denied Sudanese civilians the means to follow them to safety., As it transpired, it was Mr Erdo\u011fan who almost won at the first time of asking, winning over 49% of votes to Mr K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s 45%. For Europe and the US, which had hoped an opposition victory would see Turkey turn more towards the west, five more years of Mr Erdo\u011fan would be a highly unwelcome development \u2013 particularly ahead of a decisive period in Ukraine. Last week, Mr Erdo\u011fan announced a 45% pay hike for public sector workers, the latest in a series of moves including a reduction in electricity prices, and the offer of a month\u2019s free natural gas to households., In recent years, even as Israel\u2019s consolidation of apartheid has become increasingly blatant, Europe and the United States have continued to pressure Palestinians to accept a two-state solution that perpetuates inequality and suffering, with no regard to our right to self-determination and without any serious effort to stop settlement building. This includes dozens of illegal settlements, the construction of a segregation wall (most of which was built on Palestinian land), and an Israeli political discourse that stresses there will only be one state \u2013 a \u201cJewish state\u201d \u2013 between the Jordan River and Mediterranean Sea. A growing number of Palestinians believe that the only solution left is a single democratic state on the whole of historic Palestine without occupation, apartheid or discrimination., It stands to reason that the crackdown on human and cultural rights will intensify if Erdo\u011fan remains president at the helm of an alliance that has already forced Turkey\u2019s  , the international contract that aims to protect women against gender-based violence and discrimination, with the argument that such a contract \u201cviolated Turkey\u2019s family values\u201d. While many thought that the opposition\u2019s campaign, centred around  , unity and an end to the toxic polarisation in the country, was a breath of fresh air; others have criticised K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s approach for targeting mostly those who already agreed with his views, for his blue-sky attitude and focus on positive soundbites on social media. The elections mobilised tens of thousands of volunteers who campaigned for K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu and other opposition parties, who rallied to get out the vote, who monitored voting, protected ballot boxes and reported inconsistencies., Looking for an upside, analysts suggest Assad\u2019s return to the Arab fold, coupled with the   between his ally, Iran, and Saudi Arabia, may spawn a homegrown Middle East security order. Assad\u2019s Syria will remain deeply unstable whatever happens \u2013 divided between the partially Turkish-occupied north-west, where jihadists roam free; the Kurdish-governed north-east, viscerally hostile to Damascus; and the mostly regime-controlled centre and south. he   of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime \u2013 Syria\u2019s criminal president has been   in Saudi Arabia \u2013 makes sense to cynical Arab governments., The president has made his country a major regional player, balancing ties with the west and Russia; the alliance have indicated they would turn towards the west, and Sweden hopes an opposition victory would speed its entry into Nato. But even if Mr K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu wins the presidential race, the coalition must also triumph in the parliamentary contest to carry through its keystone pledge to end the centralisation of power in the presidency and restore parliamentary democracy. His defeat, after 20 years in power, could allow Turkey to move back towards democracy and greater freedom \u2013 the pledge which unites the multiparty opposition Nation\u2019s Alliance., After   as Turkey\u2019s most dominant politician, he can count on a wide range of support thanks to the web of political money that spans the country to feed his supporters, the fear of all things foreign that he inculcates in many Turkish people, and his mastery in exploiting religious sensitivities. The party-state he has built, under the banner of his Justice and Development party (AKP), has not only undermined all the democratic mechanisms in Turkey but also created a model citizen who believes in submission to the regime \u2013 the millions who see themselves in Erdo\u011fan\u2019s image. If the unlikely unity coalition of opposition parties beats the goliath that is President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Turkey will be able to tear off the straitjacket that it has worn for years., At a Miami conference   in March, the tech entrepreneur Ben Horowitz enthused: \u201cHe\u2019s creating a new culture, he\u2019s creating a new vision for the country, he\u2019s got a very exciting plan to execute, and the people in the country are fired up to do it.\u201d Mr Biden fist-bumped the crown prince; in November, the administration told a US court that he   in a civil lawsuit over Mr Khashoggi\u2019s death. Cristiano Ronaldo took first place thanks to his move to the Saudi club Al-Nassr, while golfers Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson shot into the top 10 after joining the LIV Golf tour., The fact that Erdo\u011fan, unusually, is trailing slightly in the polls behind his presidential rival, Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, head of the People\u2019s Republican party and leader of a six-party opposition alliance, is a sign that the political ground may be shifting. Another potentially election-deciding shift came on Friday when the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Democratic party (HDP) \u2013 whose leader, Selahattin Demirta\u015f, was jailed seven years ago on spurious terrorism charges \u2013  . Analysts suggest that Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Justice and Development party and its ultra-nationalist allies may also  , following previous, significant local election defeats in Istanbul and Ankara., Already, more than 450 lives have been lost and thousands have been injured since the clash between Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, head of the Sudanese army, and Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (known as Hemedti), the leader of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, began on 15 April. As Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general,   on Tuesday, the power struggle is not only putting Sudan\u2019s future at risk but also \u201clighting a fuse that could detonate across borders, causing immense suffering for years\u201d. Many more  , too ill to leave, unable to scrape together the cash needed to travel, or too scared to risk leaving shelter \u2013 especially when outbreaks of violence have continued \u2013 for an uncertain future., Many of our party were denied entry, including some British citizens \u2013 the British government again seemed to have made no effort to help its citizens get safe passage to Egypt despite its close ties with the country. I am a dual-national, British and Sudanese, and my husband and children are British citizens \u2013 so we contacted the embassy. The final straw for us came on Saturday 22 April when Dutch, French, Italian and Greek citizens \u2013 not diplomats \u2013 were informed they would be flown back home from an airstrip in Khartoum (this happened on the Sunday and Monday, as the Eid ceasefire was coming to an end)., The international community applied clumsy sanctions that did little but weaken the Sudanese people\u2019s capacity to resist their despotic government; a cynical cohort of undemocratic governments and monarchies in north Africa and the Middle East backed both the army and militia after the 2019 revolution, in order to extinguish the prospect of a democracy flourishing in their back yard; and lately, Russia has partnered   to extract gold and forge security interests. That was until a paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), and the country\u2019s army went to war over who runs the country \u2013 and trapped the Sudanese people between them. Slogans calling for democracy, even if they were momentarily chanted across the land, were soon drowned out by demands from the different factions, rebel groups, civilian parties and embedded elite interests who all had a different idea of the Sudan that should emerge after the revolution., Because imagining Tunisia without this or that side, Tunisia without Ennahdha, Tunisia without political Islam, without the Left, without any of its components, is a civil war project. Tunisia moved from Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali\u2019s autocratic rule to democracy with a thriving civil society and lively media, while others descended into anarchy, bloodshed and brutal repression. On Monday, scores of police  , leader of Ennahda who was elected speaker of the parliament, seizing on his remark that \u201cthere is a paralysis, intellectual and ideological, which, in reality, lays the ground for civil war., The fighting between the Sudanese armed forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) \u2013 Sudan\u2019s two main military organisations \u2013 that  , Khartoum, on 15 April is unprecedented even given Sudan\u2019s turbulent and violent history. The UK, in particular, which usually leads on   at the UN security council, has a special responsibility to show strong leadership, including imposing targeted sanctions against all abusive leaders and expanding the existing arms embargo to cover all of Sudan. The security council has long been passive in the face of the former president Omar al-Bashir\u2019s obstruction of justice and the Sudanese authorities\u2019 recent lack of cooperation with the international criminal court\u2019s investigation into crimes in Darfur., Many feared that Sudan\u2019s General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the de facto leader and army chief, and  , the vice-president who controls the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces and is known as Hemedti,  . The current conflict between them was triggered by plans to integrate   RSF \u2013 fostered by Mr Bashir as a counterweight to the army \u2013 into the regular military, under controversial plans supposed to bring about   following 2021\u2019s coup. Hemedti has portrayed himself as a protector of the 2019 revolution and some civilian leaders have, unenthusiastically, seen him as a possible defence against dictatorship under General Burhan., During my stay with her in Canada, Lujain told me of her struggle to find new, meaningful connections in her adopted home country after leaving her friends and family behind in Syria; of the pain of losing those relationships: \u201cI knew I was not going to see them again. While it felt like we were finally able to gain some closure on the lost years, seeing Lujain again has also brought up new questions for me. In February 2023, I flew from the UK to Canada and we were reunited for the first time since the war began., This week I spoke to  , who warned that while some have said Netanyahu\u2019s changes would turn Israel into Turkey or Hungary, it would be much worse than that: \u201cHungary is still a member of the European Union. A government with unlimited power, with no supreme court standing in its way, would face no obstacle if it moved towards theocracy, as some in the coalition wish, or if it decided to annex the West Bank while granting no citizenship or rights to the millions of Palestinians who live there. Israel\u2019s occupation is now in its 56th year, and that has been a disaster for the Palestinians most obviously, but it has also been a calamity for Israel itself., He said: \u201cA criminal plan has been set up since the beginning of this century to alter the demographic structure of   and certain parties received loads of money to enable the occupation of irregular sub-Saharan migrants in Tunisia.\u201d Tunisia became the first Arab country to ban slavery in the 19th century, but its legacy can still be seen in Arabic slurs that refer to black people as slaves. He claimed that \u201csuccessive waves of illegal immigration\u201d were part of a secret plot to dilute Tunisia\u2019s Arab-Islamic identity into \u201ca purely African country\u201d., What ultimately brought the country to standstill, what brought thousands of Israelis almost spontaneously out of their beds and onto the streets late Sunday night, was Netanyahu\u2019s firing of his defense minister Yoav Gallant, after Gallant warned that the scale of protest against the judicial overhaul plan within the army was putting Israel\u2019s military capacities and security at risk. The protest movement will either transform into a call for genuine democracy \u2013 for Palestinians and Israelis alike \u2013 or it will remain locked in the current impasse, in the chaotic push-and-pull between the forces of the status quo and the forces of the extreme right that the status quo has produced. Now, the hard right wants to move beyond managing the occupation toward what some of its politicians, like finance minister Betzalel Smotrich, call a \u201cdecisive\u201d moment \u2013 toward the final defeat of the Palestinian national movement, the de jure annexation of the West Bank and the expulsion of the Palestinians living there., Whether or not it materialises, sceptics note that Mr Ben-Gvir is bigger on rhetoric than delivery, and that Mr Netanyahu will not want him to have his own armed power base \u2013 the pledge to hand a man   of inciting racism a   is inherently horrifying. And though the court has repeatedly undercut Palestinian rights in the West Bank and helped to entrench the occupation, the prime minister\u2019s far-right coalition partners are angered by even its modest rulings outlawing Israeli settlements. He could back off \u2013 for now \u2013 on allowing the Knesset to override the supreme court with a simple majority, while  on increasing political control of judicial selection and preventing the court from having oversight of basic laws \u2013 elements that have already passed a first reading., Ayman Mohamed Saleh Al Sanabani is a Yemeni citizen and plaintiff in a lawsuit against  , the United Arab Emirates, the US state department, the US defense department, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics for human rights violations in Yemen This attack was just one of the thousands of indiscriminate bombings carried out on the people of Yemen by the   and a Saudi Arabia-led coalition since September 2015 under the guise of stopping Houthi rebels. It was a major departure from his predecessors, Donald Trump and Barack Obama, and it brought hope to Yemenis here and around the world, as well as international observers and human rights organizations and activists., The recent   by Netanyahu\u2019s coalition government consists of curtailing judicial review of legislation, changes to the makeup of the judicial selection committee designed to ensure the government controls appointments to the bench, cancellation of supreme court intervention in cases of extremely unreasonable executive orders, and the transformation of ministerial legal advisers into political appointees. Foreign pressure may provide the more moderate elements of the governing coalition with a ladder to climb down, before Israel heads into the abyss and wreaks havoc in the Middle East. This emigration shock will have far-ranging consequences, as there are large, weaker sectors that essentially live off the strength of the hi-tech sector, which contributes 25% of Israel\u2019s income tax revenues., Some of the lines I wrote in the early days of the invasion crystallise my melancholy: I had always hoped to see the end of Saddam\u2019s dictatorship at the hands of the Iraqi people, not courtesy of a neocolonial project that would dismantle what had remained of the Iraqi state and replace it with a regime based on ethno-sectarian dynamics, plunging the country into violent chaos and civil wars. While there was popular opposition throughout the world (there were coordinated   in February 2003), the war\u2019s architects, merchants and cheerleaders were vociferous and dismissive of those of us who warned against the catastrophic aftermath for Iraqis and the region, labelling anyone who questioned the war a supporter of dictatorship. The \u201cnew Iraq\u201d that the warmongers promised did not bring Starbucks or startups, but car bombs, suicide bombings, al-Qaida and later   \u2013 the latter hatched in the US\u2019s own military prisons in Iraq., From the use of chemical weapons in Syria (where Russia and Iran intervened on the side of the murderous Assad regime) to Yemen, Taiwan and the South China Sea, to Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic weapons programme, a new sense of impunity has coalesced into ever more obvious military alignments between several of these states. Because the invasion of Iraq unquestionably created a space for a bad actor such as Putin to challenge one of the most essential elements of modern international law regarding conflict: that states should not acquire territory by conquest. However you judge the motives of Bush and the then British prime minister, Tony Blair, who led the charge to invade \u2013 foolish, venal, messianic or self-serving \u2013 their tearing up of the rules-based international order to launch an intervention based on misinformation established a precedent that would be exploited by Moscow and others., Iraqis watched as power stations and national treasures were looted, while American troops guarded the oil ministry and Donald Rumsfeld, the defence secretary,   the turmoil: \u201cFreedom\u2019s untidy\u201d. A military adventure conceived by many of its players as a brash reassertion of US supremacy in the wake of the September 11 attacks only weakened and undermined the country \u2013 all the more so after the horrors of Abu Ghraib and wider brutality against civilians. The refugee flows produced by regional instability, along with IS-led or -inspired attacks in Europe, contributed to growing ethno-nationalism and fuelled support for Brexit., Listening to Gordon Corera\u2019s  , a riveting new BBC Radio 4 series featuring interviews with several of the key players, you are reminded that the intelligence chiefs themselves also deserve condemnation for passing on such ropy information \u2013 some of it second- or third-hand, some of it from sources who turned out to be \u201cfabricators\u201d \u2013 for allowing themselves to be badgered into packaging it to suit a political project on a political timetable, and for over-claiming its reliability. The arguments Blair and Bush made for war on Iraq were multiple, but a central tenet of the case for military intervention was that this was for the good of the Iraqi people themselves, who would be freed from the grip of a brutal tyrant. When making the case for war, Blair placed huge emphasis on the intelligence he had seen, which, he said, left it \u201c \u201d that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction., At the forum, the journalist Jane Arraf   the current Iraq prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, what \u201creasons\u201d and grounds for hope he could give to young Iraqis so they would stay in the country. This month, Iraqi politicians and officials met with policymakers, academics, journalists and other representatives from around the world at the 7th Sulaimani Forum, held at the American University of Iraq in Sulaimani. In his answer, he did not address the root causes of suffering; he instead acknowledged his government\u2019s inability to provide young people with jobs in the public sector owing to \u201cfinancial conditions\u201d, and spoke about the \u201c \u201d (entrepreneurship) initiative for development and employment, via the private sector., Assuming the deal goes ahead \u2013 there are two months for details to be ironed out \u2013 the containment of Saudi-Iranian tensions will not necessarily lead to a deeper rapprochement, let alone end Lebanon\u2019s woes or   in Yemen. The huge cost and reputational damage of the Saudi intervention in Yemen (in support of the internationally recognised government) gave an initially gung-ho Riyadh pause too. He was describing Iran and Saudi Arabia\u2019s agreement last week   \u2013 a surprise to most observers, and something of a coup for China, which brokered it., He urged security forces to take urgent measures against migrants from sub-Saharan  , who he claimed were moving to the country and creating an \u201cunnatural\u201d situation as part of a criminal plan designed to \u201cchange the demographic makeup\u201d and turn Tunisia into \u201cjust another African country that doesn\u2019t belong to the Arab and Islamic nations any more\u201d. In Arab north Africa, racism towards black people is complicated even further by a paranoia of proximity \u2013 being situated on the African continent means there is an extreme sensitivity to being considered African at all, or God forbid, black. Racism towards black Arabs and black sub-Saharan Africans is entrenched in the Arab world \u2013 a legacy of slavery and a fetishised Arab ethnic supremacy., When the SNP defeated Labour in the Scottish elections of 2007 and that country\u2019s politics underwent a watershed change \u2013 just as Blair stepped down \u2013 it happened partly because the SNP\u2019s then leader, Alex Salmond, had successfully tapped into huge anger about the war, baldly  (as one academic study put it, \u201cvoter problems with Westminster were responsible, with some dissatisfaction with the performance and leadership of the UK government and also with the issue of Iraq\u201d). Next Monday will mark 20 years since the invasion of Iraq: a reminder not just of Blair et al\u2019s responsibility for the greatest political and humanitarian disaster the UK had been involved in since the second world war, but a moment when the supposed political centre ground suddenly lurched somewhere reckless and catastrophic. Then, as the invasion loomed and the UN security council considered its options, Blair said that \u201c \u201d, whereas President Jacques Chirac had said  : that UN weapons inspectors needed to be given more time, and if Iraq did not cooperate, \u201cregrettably, the war would become inevitable., In addition, you chose not to include the following pertinent facts: disruption due to industrial action at Queen Mary has been limited, with less than 2% of our staff taking strike action; and we continue to have very low academic staff turnover, with published figures showing we are consistently lower than the university sector and the Russell Group. , president and principal, Queen Mary University of London, London E1 Last Sunday morning, I read two articles in your Sports section, one telling me how Liverpool were a spent force (\u201c \u201d) and one how Manchester United were younger, highly motivated and better organised (\u201c \u201d). Those of us who care for Israeli democracy stand four-square behind the opposition to Netanyahu both on the streets and in the Knesset. , director, Labour Friends of Israel London WC1 Your article about the failure of most NHS trusts to meet cancer waiting targets was horribly familiar (\u201c \u201d, News). It is also clear that Netanyahu\u2019s self-serving efforts to debilitate the judiciary and the repellent actions of his far-right allies do not command the support of the Israeli people, who have shown the strength of their opposition in demonstrations now entering their 10th week., Whether in Turkey,  , Afghanistan, Iran or war-torn Ukraine \u2026 as we mark International Women\u2019s Day, women and girls and minorities across the world are suffering and struggling disproportionately. Yet instead of helping women and minorities by implementing the Istanbul convention \u2013 the treaty designed to combat violence against women \u2013 the government under Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has done the opposite,   and targeting both feminists and LGBTQ+ activists. The humanitarian organisation Plan International   that, \u201cOur experience shows that children, especially girls, women and the poorest families, are most at risk of exploitation in a disaster like an earthquake., The money won\u2019t be lent to a dictatorial regime without support from civil society \u2013 notably Tunisia\u2019s powerful labour   \u2013 which Mr Saied has been repressing. Tunisia\u2019s president, Kais Saied,   the New York Times in 2021, quoting the words of the French statesman Charles de Gaulle. Mr Saied came to power because Tunisians had grown disillusioned with a political class that seemed unable to resolve the country\u2019s problems., Beyond that extreme scenario, Israel has two paths: in one version, the pro-democratic, moderate right, centre and leftwing elements make newfound common cause and win the next elections; they may not solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but they can preserve Israel\u2019s institutions and international positioning. Earlier rightwing governments merely wanted to expand settlements or annex parts of the West Bank, deepen the hold of Jewish religious law over Israeli public and private life, harangue and intimidate Israel\u2019s Palestinian-Arab citizens. With the coalition\u2019s firm parliamentary majority, the Knesset has already passed the first reading of a bill to give the coalition control over judicial appointments and ban judicial review of Israel\u2019s Basic Laws (which serve as a type of constitution)., I spent half the trip with Labour Friends of Israel, a grouping of like-minded Labour MPs, and half with the New Israel Fund, an NGO that funds organisations that promote democracy and equality for all Israelis, based on the vision of Israel\u2019s founders. There are so many wonderful things about Israel but the deeply anti-democratic proposals being considered by Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s new  , alongside a renewed assault on the homes and most basic rights of Palestinians living in the occupied territories, will only deepen division and heighten tensions. Netanyahu\u2019s government plans to undermine judicial independence by instituting the political appointment of judges and introducing a new \u201coverriding\u201d clause, allowing any decision by the supreme court of Israel to be overridden by a simple majority vote in the Knesset., Within hours of the summit\u2019s communique, hundreds of settlers were rampaging through the   with rocks and iron bars, shooting dead one man, leaving hundreds injured and torching cars and properties \u2013 retaliation for the murder of two Israeli settlers by a Palestinian gunman earlier that day. These were the first such high-level negotiations in years, reflecting belated US re-engagement, in the unpromising context of a far-right Israeli government, a moribund Palestinian Authority and surging violence. There were around 100,000 settlers in the West Bank when the Oslo negotiations began in the early 1990s; now there are around half a million \u2013 and several play key roles in this government., Although this bureaucratic reorganisation of Israeli rule over the West Bank does not amount to legislative annexation \u2013 which the Israeli parliament did in the cases of East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights \u2013 the impact on the lives of Palestinians is the same. A recent example of this is the Israeli parliament\u2019s  , with an overwhelming majority, that empowers the interior minister to revoke the Israeli citizenship or residency status of political prisoners convicted of terror offences who receive financial aid from the Palestinian Authority. undreds of Israeli settlers descended on Sunday night on the Palestinian town of Huwara near Nablus in the West Bank., hen a   chaired by the former sports minister Tracey Crouch, explored ways to redistribute football income to non-Premier League clubs, the indignant chief executive of Leeds United, Angus Kinnear, denounced the project as akin to  .    The sports minister, Stuart Andrew, has   that the enhanced owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test would not be relevant to the most high-profile ethical dilemma facing English football \u2013 its growing exploitation as a source of soft power by super-rich authoritarian states wishing to clean up their global image. After three decades in which English football\u2019s elite clubs have moved into a different orbit from the rest, and a laissez-faire ownership culture has   the door to unscrupulous buyers, this is overdue., Siac, the tribunal that hears immigration cases involving national security issues, upheld the right of the home secretary \u2013 Sajid Javid in 2019 \u2013 to strip her of UK citizenship because her presence was not \u201cconducive to the public good\u201d. Ms Begum\u2019s case reveals that the Tories view the law not as a fundamental part of the UK\u2019s constitutional system, but as an unnecessary obstacle to the exercise of executive power. They had been   by the supreme court to only considering Ms Begum\u2019s appeal in terms of whether the process had been fair and  , rather than let judges try the case again., The judges accepted that \u201cas a matter of basic common sense\u201d Begum was groomed in the UK; that it was not plausible that she could have organised her travel to   by herself; that there is credible suspicion she was trafficked for the purposes of sexual exploitation; and that UK institutions are likely to have failed in their duty to protect her. Ministers ask us to reconcile two contradictory positions: that evidence presented by the intelligence agencies to the government shows she is a national security threat, but that there is insufficient evidence to try her on terrorism charges in a British court. Each time one of our allies brings its nationals home, it shows up the UK government\u2019s policy for what it really is: a political posture., Afghanistan is another dreadful example of humanitarian support left to the mercy of a brutal regime after the west abandoned the country to the Taliban, neglecting the needs of the country and its people. The blanket ban on a number of international non-government organisations in Pakistan following the killing of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden is another example of humanitarian assistance falling prey to politics. I am a former war correspondent in   and the week-long essentials of humanitarian practice course in Melbourne helped me explore the history of many of our household names in this sector, how they are coping or failing to cope with the ever-changing dynamics of international politics., In the aftermath of the earthquakes, experts have warned, it is imperative that independent legal committees collect samples of concrete, beams and steel support rods from collapsed buildings, and to demand the buildings\u2019 permits and licensing paperwork from municipalities, as well as proof that subcontractors have adhered to all current building safety standards and regulations. They could not have gone ahead without the government\u2019s many changes to construction and real estate legislation, all meant to facilitate the bloated growth of a destructive and insatiable construction sector. The government argues that these amnesties provide low-income and small-scale homeowners with the legal means to hook up their houses to municipal infrastructure, but critics say that they promote the construction of unsafe and unregulated housing., Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s far-right government is following the playbook written by authoritarians in Hungary, Poland and other self-declared beacons of \u201cilliberalism\u201d: subordinate the judiciary and other independent bodies like public broadcasting to government control, all in the name of \u201cthe people\u201d. But the reasons why outside observers should not hold back are still ultimately similar: doing nothing is not neutral, because it lets down the millions who voted against the current Israeli government \u2013 it won the election by a mere 30,000 votes \u2013 and who hoped that friends of the country would precisely prove their friendship by calling for tough action. Rightwing US and Israeli thinktanks are becoming ever  ; so plenty of   of the constitutional coup stand ready to convince   that proposed changes have parallels in well-functioning democracies: executive involvement in judicial appointments exists in the US as well; the Canadian parliament can   court decisions., And for the people affected by this tragedy, the last thing they need to see is their social media feeds clogged with misinformation. Legitimate fundraising operations such as the Disasters Emergency Committee have now raised   \u2013 it\u2019s important that bad actors are prevented from trying to capitalise on the fact that so many people want to help. Misleading content online can prevent those trying to help people getting the right information and support., But even if Mr Assad complies, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the hardline Islamist group that controls much of north-western Syria, is   refusing to accept help from government-controlled areas. But as the United Nations\u2019 top humanitarian relief official, Martin Griffiths,   on Sunday, this is in effect what has been allowed to happen in north-west Syria, which is controlled by groups opposed to President Bashar al-Assad. The United States has   on Mr Assad to halt the weaponisation of aid and channel international assistance equitably to rebel-held areas., The World Bank has  \u201ca deliberate depression \u2026 orchestrated by [an] elite that has long captured the state and lived off its economic rents\u201d, while poor and middle-class people bear the burden of the crisis. One small step forward would be for the UN Human Rights Council to launch a fact-finding mission on the port blast,   by bereaved relatives and civil society groups, despite cynicism about its prospects. Then, on 4 August 2020, a mammoth explosion at Beirut\u2019s port \u2013 one of the largest non-nuclear blasts ever seen \u2013\u00ad killed more than 200 people and injured thousands., Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Turkey\u2019s president, has numerous questions to answer, too, over the speed and effectiveness of his government\u2019s response and over negligent official regulation, planning, enforcement and \u201camnesty\u201d rules that permitted the construction of thousands of substandard apartment and office blocks, schools and hospitals. In government-controlled areas of Syria, too, anguish is mixed with fury at the inadequate response of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s illegitimate regime in Damascus. It can be argued that the democratic west\u2019s failure to bring Assad and his war criminal cronies to justice \u2013 and to force an end to the siege of Idlib \u2013 has indirectly worsened the impact of today\u2019s emergency., Dispossession and discrimination have been a longstanding reality here in the eastern part of the city, under Israeli military occupation for 56 years, but under the new far-right Israeli government, Jerusalem has seen a spike in demolitions \u2013 more than 30 structures were   in January alone. Most Palestinian homes are targeted for lacking a permit; indeed, in my city, at least   lack an Israeli-issued permit, putting 100,000 residents of occupied East Jerusalem at risk of forcible displacement at any given moment. In fact, since Israel\u2019s occupation of East Jerusalem began in 1967, virtually   for Palestinian neighbourhoods.   have been built for Jewish Israelis in the eastern part of the city, while   were built for Palestinians with any kind of government support., Though conflict in Syria has faded from international attention, the complex regional struggle \u2013 not only of the regime against rebels, but of Turkey against Kurdish groups and Israel against Iranian-linked targets \u2013 continues to   in the north and  The mandate for Syria cross-border aid via Turkey has, thankfully, been extended until July. The organisation also urged the international community to pressure Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime \u2013 and Moscow, which supports it \u2013 to hold back on airstrikes. Photos and footage testify to the terrible destruction wreaked on the Turkish side of the border, where the highest death toll is currently recorded., If Erdo\u011fan\u2019s sickening schmoozing of Putin, double-dealing over Ukraine, neo-Ottoman overreaching and on-off aggression towards fellow Nato member Greece are not sufficient proof of bad faith, then consider his other war \u2013 on his country\u2019s democracy. As the most important Turkish elections in a generation move towards a febrile climax in May, and as the western democracies contemplate critical choices in Ukraine, over Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, and in Iran, Syria and Israel-Palestine, these dilemmas boil down to one basic question: is it time to admit that two-faced   is no friend of the west \u2013 and punish him accordingly?   Sign up to  Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion ll of which leads back to the original question: what should the western democracies do about Erdo\u011fan, assuming he wins again?, Kahneman was not speaking about a foreign army massing on the country\u2019s borders, an Iranian nuclear bomb or the gathering prospect of a   (though we\u2019ll get to that), but rather something Israel is doing to itself: what Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, gently calls his  , but what others describe as the evisceration of the Israeli courts, handing unchecked power to the government. That could, in turn, prompt a sea change among Palestinian-Israelis, a recognition that a de facto boycott of Israel\u2019s political institutions might have made sense when a separate Palestinian state seemed on the horizon, but makes no sense now. Their objection is to a plan that would limit the supreme court\u2019s power to strike down the decisions of politicians, allow Netanyahu or any future prime minister to override a court ruling by a simple majority in parliament, and make judges the handpicked appointments of politicians., With no viable path to their own state, Palestinians see settlements consume ever more land and little prospect of change to conditions which Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and a UN rapporteur \u2013 as well as the Israeli human rights group B\u2019Tselem \u2013 have described as  , though distinct from that seen in South Africa. Last year   in Israel and the West Bank and Jerusalem since the second intifada ended in 2005, with about 150 Palestinians and 30 Israelis killed, and another 49 Palestinians   on the Gaza Strip in August. Support for a two-state solution has   among both Palestinians and Israeli Jews, falling to its lowest level since polling began about two decades ago., By endangering western public support for the state of Israel, undermining its democracy and confounding its alliances, Netanyahu and his hate-mongering cronies show themselves to be their country\u2019s own worst enemies. Worse still, perhaps, Netanyahu\u2019s band of bigots is actively undermining Israel\u2019s democratic institutions and civil rights, such as peaceful protest and LGBTQ rights. The main reason is a new ultranationalist, hard-right religious coalition government in Jerusalem that includes racist, anti-Arab ministers determined to annex all the Palestinian territories., The plan announced by the justice minister, Yariv Levin, would allow even the slimmest Knesset majority to override supreme court decisions \u2013 which would mean that controversial new laws could be pushed through, targeting minorities, civil society and the right to protest against annexation. He has ordered police to tear down Palestinian flags, and the government is   by seizing Palestinian Authority funds in retaliation for it asking the international court of justice in The Hague for an advisory opinion on Israel\u2019s occupation of the West Bank. His extremist coalition partners were an expedient choice, given their desire to undermine the supreme court and scrap its rulings outlawing Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank., He told Professor Kathryn Sikkink, a highly respected human rights scholar affiliated with the Kennedy School, that the reason was my, and Human Rights Watch\u2019s, criticism of Israel. Soon after I announced my departure from Human Rights Watch, the Kennedy School\u2019s Carr Center for Human Rights Policy reached out to me to discuss offering me a fellowship. Some defenders of the Israeli government have claimed that Elmendorf\u2019s rejection of my fellowship was because Human Rights Watch, or I, devote too much attention to Israel., Likewise, the west\u2019s failure to seriously address the Israel-Palestine conflict allowed Iran\u2019s hardliners to grow their influence with Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. The evident depth of anger and enmity felt within Iran\u2019s regime over Suleimani\u2019s killing and many other long-festering grievances is not wholly surprising, yet it should give western governments pause. A ceremony in Tehran last week marking the third anniversary of the assassination in Iraq by a US drone of Qassem Suleimani, a senior commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), conveyed a defiant message to the west., After two years of its hermit-like isolation, 1.4 billion Chinese citizens are now experiencing a nationwide Covid onslaught for the first time with ripples that will not only affect the lives of those in   but the rest of the world linked to the second largest economy. Just as we celebrate those individuals fighting against injustice, we can also find hope in those other warriors for our future \u2013 those in health care, laboratories and research institutions working to find solutions to climate change or disease. He said: Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centres of energy and daring those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance., Denied marriage rights and civil unions and historically subject to homophobia and transphobia, Ukraine\u2019s \u201c \u201d troops have helped to destroy local stereotypes and deliver a crucial lesson in what dangerous misdirection it is to join culture wars about other people\u2019s pronouns when the real enemy is bombing your homeland. Since Russia invaded his country on 24 February, the man   in fetish gear to songs about borscht has cut a definitive profile of courageous leadership, and served as both representative and publicist for the indomitable bravery of Ukraine\u2019s people and communities. Yet throughout November young people gathered across the country with blank pieces of paper \u2013 to denote government censorship of dissent \u2013 and a fearlessness of consequence to fight China\u2019s impractical and unworkable \u201cCovid zero\u201d restrictions., This undocumented tortoise was spotted crossing the land border between   and Greece one early morning in August, shortly after we had emerged from a long queue to have our passports stamped. Reflecting on the origins of private property, the Genevan philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote that the first person who enclosed a plot of land and said \u201cthis is mine\u201d \u2013 and found people \u201csimple\u201d enough to believe this account \u2013 was the true founder of civil society. \u201cIf within a territory of a people there is any deserted or unproductive soil,\u201d Hugo Grotius, the 17th-century Dutch founding father of international law, wrote, \u201cit is a right of foreigners to take possession of such land.\u201d, At university, I sat in the press box at Lincoln City covering matches, and eventually found myself working on one of the longest-running and most successful football video games \u2013 one I\u2019d played religiously from my early teens. With my colleagues, I felt a bit embarrassed to admit what I was doing, given so much of what we do revolves around following top-level football. I\u2019m sure the BBC and ITV won\u2019t miss one viewer, and Fifa have already made millions selling TV rights for the North American World Cup in 2026., The EU was \u201ca huge global player, and of course, everything from tech companies to states outside the EU is going to try to influence it,\u201d she said. Their detention followed Belgian police raids that turned up \u20ac1.5m in cash, allegedly to be used for advancing EU visa liberalisation and aviation deals favourable to Qatar. Schinas represented the EU at the opening ceremony of the men\u2019s football World Cup in Qatar.   , In 2019, he triumphed in Istanbul\u2019s re-run mayoral contest after Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ruling AKP party refused, Trump-like, to accept his initial victory. But in what looks like more Erdo\u011fan-inspired chicanery, a court is due to rule next month on banning the party for alleged terrorism links. For Erdo\u011fan, politics is personal \u2013 and \u0130mamo\u011flu represents possibly the biggest threat to his re-election hopes in next year\u2019s presidential poll., There is still time to make some partial amends for the mistake made in 2010 when \u2013 after a   bidding process \u2013 Fifa awarded the World Cup to a super-rich oil state with a   human rights record and draconian anti-gay laws. He stands within touching distance of a World Cup winners\u2019 medal to complete arguably the greatest career in football history. The first African and Arab team to reach a World Cup semi-final were both a revelation and a source of continental and cultural  ., You wonder why the UK has not explored the possibility of using human rights sanctions against President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi\u2019s regime in Egypt, where torture by security officials is endemic, hundreds of people have been sentenced to death in mass trials for political offences and a British citizen, Alaa Abd el-Fattah, has been   for sharing a Facebook post. Just days ago, the Foreign Office was scrambling to withdraw comments by a minister, David Rutley, acknowledging that Saudi Arabian authorities had tortured a Jordanian father facing imminent execution,  by Saudi authorities. Cleverly cites the UK\u2019s use of sanctions against individuals and institutions in Russia, Iran and Myanmar, and few would object to a British foreign secretary taking a tough line on these regimes\u2019 abuses., Our experience teaches us to focus on the strengths of the people and invest in available natural resources, including livestock, agriculture, the blue economy and digitalisation to achieve sustainable development for and with the people. The liberation of people from terrorism, the strong grassroots-led uprising against al-Shabaab and the international partnership helping to facilitate the success of the war on terrorism are the real strengths that must be complemented with stabilisation assistance to ensure these historic gains become permanent. Somalia is threatened by al-Shabaab, the group linked to al-Qaida, who have made it their business to kill, maim and extort the Somali people for the past 15 years., Yaakov Katz, editor-in-chief of the Jerusalem Post, has good reason to   Mr Ben-Gvir \u201cthe modern Israeli version of an American white supremacist and a European fascist\u201d. Mr Ben-Gvir plans a provocative ministerial \u201c \u201d to Haram al-Sharif, site of the third-holiest shrine in Islam, under the pretence that Israeli Jews are struggling for their religious rights. Days earlier, Mr Wennesland had been \u201c \u201d by the fatal shooting of an unarmed Palestinian man during a scuffle with an Israeli border police officer., As we walked, he warned me that my colleagues at El Faro, the Salvadoran news organization, were being followed because of a story they were pursuing about negotiations between the president of   and the notorious MS-13 gang. So, represented by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, 14 of my colleagues at El Faro and I have decided to sue NSO Group. I was hacked while I pursued and published private videos of two brothers of President Nayib Bukele negotiating over El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin Law with foreign businessmen before it came into effect., In his 21 September address to the United Nations general assembly, Joe Biden expressed US solidarity with \u201cthe brave citizens and the brave women who right now are demonstrating to secure their basic rights\u201d in a very brief coda to a very long address about Ukraine, Putin, world hunger and \u201cour bold climate agenda\u201d. How else to explain the peculiar locution of President Biden\u2019s shoutout to \u201cthe brave citizens and the brave women\u201d, or the essay, in the 27 September Washington Post, by the Iranian-American journalist Masih Alinejad asking: \u201cWhen will Western feminists help?\u201d A 24 November New York Times article headlined \u201cUnited States Enters New Era of Direct Confrontation With Iran\u201d made it clear that these confrontations will have more to do Iran\u2019s nuclear program than with the current protest., A historical perspective shows us, ironically, that the concept of universalism, far from being merely a European outlook, was developed and enlarged through struggles against European rule, while many of the ideas of cultural relativism find their roots in European Romanticism. While many of those who stood in the Enlightenment tradition and declared that \u201call men are created equal\u201d were willing to endorse slavery and colonialism, it was through the struggles of enslaved people, of colonial subjects, of working-class people, and of women, to emancipate themselves that the ideas of equality and universalism were given a fuller meaning. The American Christian conservative Rod Dreher, a cheerleader for Donald Trump, Marine Le Pen and Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has condemned western \u201ccultural imperialism\u201d towards Qatar,   \u201cthe disgusting arrogance of western liberals who treat the diverse peoples of the world as if they are wogs who exist to be humiliated into being civilised\u201d., When Iran played England on Monday, the team pointedly  , a gesture of defiance against their country\u2019s rulers and in solidarity with its people, many thousands of whom have spent the last two months engaged in open revolt against what they see as the corrupt, repressive theocracy that has held power in Tehran for 43 years. The people of Iran are showing the world that people everywhere yearn to be governed by those whom they can elect and throw out, rather than by supposed holy men claiming unique authority to interpret holy texts. Any change in Tehran will of course send shockwaves through the region, where Iran has been a key and lethal player in the wars in Syria and Yemen; for years, Tehran has been the threat against which the Gulf states (and Israel) have cohered., More than two months after  , a 22-year-old Kurdish woman, died in custody, detained by morality police for supposedly \u201cinappropriate hijab\u201d, a spokesperson for the UN human rights chief, Volker T\u00fcrk,   that this is a \u201ccritical\u201d moment. Even as Monday\u2019s match took place, security forces were firing on protesters in the mainly Kurdish cities of Piranshahr and Javanrud, with a rights group reporting that seven died in the latter alone. But the fundamental contradiction between the priorities and beliefs of the hardliners in charge of the country, and the younger people under their suffocating, corrupt and incompetent rule, becomes more visible and more pronounced with every arrest, every beating and every death., Whenever I see people arguing hour after hour about their supposed causes on social media, I no longer even think of them as working in the service of those causes, but simply in the (perhaps unwitting) service of whichever Silicon Valley billionaire owns the digital space where they\u2019re doing it. Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist Join John Crace, Marina Hyde and Armando Iannucci for a look back at another chaotic year in Westminster, live at Kings Place in London, or via livestream. So anodyne is the wider armband advocacy movement that it seems concerned above all else with not causing offence, to the point where it is impossible to imagine it sitting even very distantly on a continuum with sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos\u2019s   at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics (and the solidarity of the silver medallist,  ), or  \u2019s heroic career self-harm., Biden has failed to live up to his promise to put human rights   of his foreign policy, and a pledge during the 2020 presidential campaign to seek accountability for Khashoggi\u2019s murder, when  : \u201cUnder a Biden-Harris administration, we will reassess our relationship with the Kingdom, end US support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s war in Yemen, and make sure America does not check its values at the door to sell arms or buy oil.\u201d he Biden administration told a US judge last week that Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, should be   in a civil lawsuit over his role in the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Today, after nearly two years in power, the Biden administration is still   and military support to Saudi Arabia, and the US has now shielded the crown prince from any meaningful accountability for Khashoggi\u2019s killing., The Conservative MP David Mundell, the first openly gay Tory cabinet minister, accepted hospitality worth \u00a37,473 from Qatar, and then, in a parliamentary debate a few months later, in response to concern raised by another MP about LGBTQ+ rights in Qatar, said that Qatar\u2019s critics should \u201cfocus their energies on the handling of LGBT issues in professional football in the UK\u201d. Qatar and other wealthy undemocratic regimes around the world are empowered in Britain, and by extension on the global stage, by a parliamentary system open to lobbying, a lucrative weapons industry, and a real-estate economy that is geared to a global wealthy elite. In the runup to the World Cup, the value of Qatar\u2019s gifts to British MPs was   than the amount spent by all the other 15 countries whose governments made donations to British MPs combined., Leaders make grand but vague pledges of action; fossil fuel lobbyists (600 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, this year) schmooze and press governments into maintaining the status quo; and scientists, civil society groups and those most affected by the climate emergency have to scream to be heard at all. This year\u2019s milestone achievement \u2013 the new fund \u2013 is essentially a victory for civil society and collective action among developing countries. Over three decades, the international political system has repeatedly demonstrated its frustrating, heartbreaking and almost bizarre inability to act on a problem that has, at its heart, a simple solution: ending our dependence on fossil fuels., Horsham, West Sussex Of course children should have the strongest protections in the online safety bill, but scrapping the need to take action on legal but extremely harmful content would be a huge own goal for sites and undermines any suggestion of the UK being a safe place to go online (\u201c \u201d, News). It\u2019s worth remembering that Prof Ben Goldacre, commissioned by the government to review how the inherent value of NHS data can be extracted effectively and safely, admitted to a Commons inquiry that he\u2019d opted out of a previous plan to mine patients\u2019 data. The lack of public consultation about a federated data platform is shameful, not least because of the claim that patients\u2019 privacy will be protected due to the data being \u201cde-identified\u201d or pseudonymised., As the England team flew into Qatar in a jet that advertised its  , Gianni Infantino, the president of Fifa, was in Bali   at the G20 summit that the World Cup could be used to stop the Russian devastation of Ukraine. On Blatter\u2019s watch, during the four decades when he was first Fifa general secretary and then president, multiple World Cup votes became the subject of corruption allegations. The difference with Qatar is that, while England failed dismally in its courtship of Fifa, eliminated on both bids with only two votes, Qatar succeeded., If the beautiful game is truly the world game, then Fifa should expect players and fans to be vocal in equal parts about the goals that get scored and issues that impact people across the globe. In a sliding doors moment, when Fifa awarded Qatar with the rights to host the 2022 World Cup, Australia also had a bid in contention. Fifa hasn\u2019t helped with the backlash, telling players to \u201cfocus on football\u201d implying that players are built to kick a ball without consequence or context., Without getting into crude national stereotyping, as I recall it, whenever there was a long, artful slow-motion replay of the wrong thing at the wrong time, the finger of blame \u2013 unfairly perhaps \u2013 would generally point at whichever French match director happened to be in charge that day. For a start, there\u2019s the ever-increasing number of camera shots to choose from, with cameras all around the ground \u2013 at the side of the pitch, high up, behind the goals, or offering a bird\u2019s eye view from above \u2013 while others follow a single player, or are trained on each of the coaches. And neither does the director want to have us admiring a lovingly curated slow-motion reprise of a fine save at one end of the pitch, while someone is putting it in the net at the other end., And with its al-Udeid airbase playing host to the forward headquarters of the US military\u2019s Central Command, Qatar sits right at the heart of western power projection into the Gulf, as it has done for more than 100 years. Even after the Gulf states gained independence in the 1960s and 70s, scores of British civilians remained in their militaries and state bureaucracies, including in Qatar\u2019s, to ensure the regimes\u2019 survival and their correct geopolitical orientation. It was British imperial power that first integrated the Gulf states of Kuwait, Bahrain,  , the UAE and Oman into the structures of the global economy with discoveries of vast oil and gas reserves sealing the region\u2019s status as a major material and geostrategic prize., Re gallery directors saying that climate activists attacking art \u201cseverely underestimate\u201d the fragility of works ( ), I think the issue is that governments and the public severely underestimate how fragile the ecosystem is. As the person who cooked in a safe house for those going out on action during the recent   project, I was so grateful to   and   for their always brilliant recipes in Feast magazine. I am writing to beg Joe Lycett to donate his \u00a310,000 to Trussell Trust food banks or any charity or school desperate for funds ( )., When I turned seven, they covered my head with the ugliest scarf in the world, which looked like a burlap sack, and sent me to school where, even though it was staffed solely by women, no one was allowed to remove the scarf.

From the first moments of the event, I felt gloomy as my family cast concerned looks at me while the press took pictures of my hair freely protruding from my scarf and clothes \u2013 a deliberate rebellion on my part against Iran\u2019s conservative traditions and beliefs., But the  , which kicks off next Sunday, so far seems to have done more to stain the image of football than improve Qatar\u2019s.   as well as human rights campaigners have complained that this looks more like a grubby hymn to money and power than a joyous celebration of the game \u2013 even if the drama and tension of the tournament will end up overwhelming many people\u2019s qualms. Last week, a Qatar World Cup ambassador   homosexuality as \u201cdamage in the mind\u201d and Sepp Blatter, the former head of Fifa,   Qatar was a bad choice as host (though only because it was \u201ctoo small a country\u201d). Regimes seeking kudos have gained the assistance of sports stars \u2013 from David Beckham to Pep Guardiola \u2013 and international institutions who employ high-flown rhetoric about athletic excellence and global friendship while trousering large sums., Iran\u2019s players are uncomfortably aware of regime efforts to use football (and them) to present a normal face to the world and distract attention from the crisis at home. The Saudi regime has turned Qatar-style sportwashing \u2013 reputation laundering \u2013 into a successful industry through lavish sponsorship of international sporting events and the purchase of the English Premier League club Newcastle United. Now, pressed into action by this murderous regime, Iran\u2019s   is about to play England, Wales and the US in the 2022 World Cup \u2013 as if nothing untoward were happening., In other ages and cultures, much care and attention has been lavished on nit comb design: the V&amp;A museum has a 12th-century comb decorated with seven scenes from the Bible; an ornate 15th-century French comb was inscribed with the words \u201cfor your comfort\u201d. On a half-term visit to the Mary Rose Museum in Portsmouth\u2019s historic dockyard, amid the world\u2019s largest collection of Tudor artefacts, my sons and I admired the collection of 82 wooden nit combs dredged from the Solent in 1982 after four centuries embedded in the sea mud. The sentiment, and the design of the fine-toothed comb it was inscribed on, could not have been more relevant to my life; ever since schools reopened, I have been engaged, like many parents, in a seemingly never-ending battle against head lice., At the 1934 World Cup, in Italy, Mussolini\u2019s blackshirts explicitly used the Italian national team to build support for fascism, winning their home tournament, and winning again in France four years later, the first team to win an away World Cup. In Qatar, homosexuality is illegal and   by Qatar World Cup ambassador Khalid Salman as \u201cdamage in the mind\u201d. The winners of football\u2019s World Cup are a likewise select few from Europe and South America, but the teams that make it to the semi- and quarter-finals come from every continent, every corner of the world., The government must now live up to its promise to Mr Abd el-Fattah\u2019s family by applying maximum pressure by all means, including through military and intelligence channels, making it clear that a failure to grant access will cost Egypt dearly in key aspects of the relationship. Mr Sunak raised Mr Abd el-Fattah\u2019s case with the president, but does not appear to have exacted the price for their meeting in advance. It is an outrage that Mr Abd el-Fattah was jailed at all; that he has spent most of the last decade in prison; that he was sentenced to another five years for sharing a social media post about torture; and that he is denied consular visits \u2013 the trigger for his hunger strike., While Mr Sunak declares that he will spend the \u00a311bn   by Mr Johnson to help poorer countries adapt to global heating, he won\u2019t say he will keep to the plan to pay out the cash over five years. Under Mr Johnson there were   dedicated to climate, one chaired by Mr Sharma and one by the prime minister. He did sit down with France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron, and the Italian far-right prime minister,  , to discuss a subject \u2013 \u201cillegal migration\u201d \u2013 that Mr Sunak obviously cares about., The whole world is watching what happens in Sharm el-Sheikh, where I write this from, and he is staking his life on a belief that the world will today stand with him. t 10am on Sunday morning my brother Alaa drank his last sip of water in an Egyptian prison. So far, the UK government has not even been able to gain consular access to Alaa in prison, a basic request., He lives in a settlement in Hebron known as Kiryat Arba, home to some of the most extreme Israeli settlers in the West Bank, and he has built a legal career defending Jewish Israeli extremists.  includes supporting full Israeli annexation of the West Bank and he has been at the forefront of supporting Israeli settler violence across Palestine. But a mere glance at the policy positions of his party,  ,  on the West Bank reveals what it means by a two-state solution: annexation of the settlement blocs that will result in cutting the West Bank in half, leaving only islands of Palestinian autonomy. Yet despite this prospect, for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza the Israeli elections have not been at the forefront of political discussion, as they continue to resist and fight for their survival on ever-shrinking territory., Climate justice, racial justice, economic justice, social justice \u2013 all are interlinked. can\u2019t just be a talking shop, it must deliver climate justice for all \u2013 and standing in solidarity with Alaa and demanding his freedom epitomises this call. And there is no climate justice without racial justice., They mark the triumph of the racist far right, in the form of Mr Netanyahu\u2019s   allies, who want the deportation of \u201cdisloyal\u201d Palestinian citizens of Israel and the annexation of the occupied West Bank. Mr Netanyahu appears unfazed, doubtless counting on a Republican resurgence and Donald Trump\u2019s return in 2024, and the unlikelihood of Washington taking the kind of action that might make Likud think again in the meantime. Thanks to Mr Netanyahu, he now dominates the third-largest political force in Israel, and is expected to become a senior minister., In the run-up to the election, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed, the UAE\u2019s foreign minister, conveyed his concerns to Netanyahu about Religious Zionism and Ben-Gvir. Most strikingly, the ascendance of the Religious Zionism party and Ben-Gvir will discomfit the Biden White House and test the US-Israel alliance. Netanyahu and Ben-Gvir provide political cover., In 2021, Mansour Abbas, an Israeli Arab, brought his Ra\u2019am party into the governing coalition led by Yair Lapid, the current centrist prime minister, and Naftali Bennett, his nationalist predecessor. Those who advocate boycotting the election see themselves as rejecting Israel\u2019s legitimacy, and that of local Arab-Israeli political leaders, a sentiment I heard as I spoke to students on the campus of Haifa university. He has also pledged to go easy in cases involving Israel\u2019s military and law enforcement, The convergence of Ben-Gvir\u2019s and Netanyahu\u2019s ambitions and intentions is overt., The 2008 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics in China; the 2014 Winter Olympics in Russia; the Bahrain Grand Prix; the 2019   in Qatar; the 2019 Anthony Joshua  : there is an indisputable trend of big sporting events being hosted by rich but unsavoury countries. There is the push factor of dictatorships around the world seeking to launder their reputations through the medium of international sport \u2013 $200bn on a World Cup doesn\u2019t just secure international visitors and sporting entertainment but PR that money normally can\u2019t buy. This World Cup is just the latest in a long line of expensive international sporting events that have been hosted by nations that stand accused of fundamental human rights breaches., that Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, foreign minister of the UAE, conveyed his concern to Netanyahu about the leaders of the   party, Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich. With just days to go,   and the right lead in hypothetical match-ups, but may fall short of the 61 seats needed in the 120-member Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament, to dislodge Yair Lapid, the current prime minister. In the 2021 election, Israel\u2019s Arabs provided the votes needed to see Netanyahu thrown out of office, but 20 months later, that same constituency appears dispirited., In unconventional warfare there is very much a \u201cdirty\u201d nuclear threat, which could be almost as devastating as a battlefield nuclear weapon, by turning nuclear power stations into improvised nuclear weapons \u2013 in essence a massive \u201cdirty\u201d bomb. The \u201cdirty\u201d bomb concept is a complete chimera \u2013 a fantasy designed to terrify people in Ukraine and allow Russia to escalate its unconventional warfare. His ridiculous claim that Ukraine is planning to use a   \u2013 an explosive device containing radioactive material \u2013 implies he is now groping towards more unconventional methods of warfare., The British architect Norman Foster (again a Pritzker winner) withdrew from the advisory board of Neom over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, but his practice continues to work on Saudi projects such as the Red Sea airport and an \u201cexperiential marine-life centre\u201d. It is aided and abetted by western consultancies such as the once-hip Californian practice of Morphosis (which is designing The Line) and the London-based Zaha Hadid Architects (at work in Trojena), both of them winners of the biggest prize in architecture, the Pritzker. More recent examples include the decision by the also Pritzker-winning Dutch practice OMA to design the vast headquarters of the Chinese government\u2019s main television station CCTV, completed in 2012; as the writer Ian Buruma asked: would they have done the same favour for Pinochet\u2019s Chile?, As international law professor   pointed out: \u201cRecognising only West Jerusalem as the capital was still contrary to the international legal consensus \u2026 The Morrison government\u2019s position was also nonsensical, since Israel does not claim \u2018West\u2019 Jerusalem as its capital, but all of Jerusalem. It is time that Australia follows the international human rights community recognition of Israel as an apartheid regime and use its power to hold Israel accountable for its crimes against humanity, including, as   out, by \u201crescinding its objection to an international criminal court investigation into allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity\u201d. Recent reports by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the former and current United Nations special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian Territories, as well as Palestinian and Israeli NGOs conclude that Israel has put in place a system of racial domination, with an  Israeli apartheid, the UN Special Rapporteur on the oPt, Francesca Albanese, determined just a few days ago in her new report, \u201cis the hallmark of settler-colonialism, and a war crime under the Rome Statute\u201d., A few weeks after the start of the occupation in 1967, my father, Aziz Shehadeh, submitted   \u2013 for which he was able to get the support of 50 prominent Palestinian leaders from different parts of the occupied territories \u2013 for the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, according to the  , with its capital in the Arab section of Jerusalem. Likewise, any restraint on Israel in the form of opposition to this illegality from Britain, the EU and the US, has been entirely ineffective and restricted to formulaic statements, leaving Israel free to violate international law on building settlements in the occupied territories with total impunity. Then, last February, the Israeli attorney general moved to authorise the re-establishment of the evacuated Israeli settlement of  , on land that is privately owned by Palestinians, near Beita on Jabal Sabih., Prince Mohammed had clearly concluded that he can get away with keeping oil prices high and undermining the US and EU campaign to isolate Russia \u2013 and still secure US protection and military assistance because Biden can\u2019t get past the decades-old policy of American support for the House of Saud. This oil-for-security arrangement has lasted through Democratic and Republican administrations, including multiple crises like the Arab-led oil embargo and Opec price increases in the 1970s and the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, where 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals recruited by Al-Qaida. Since Prince Mohammed rose to power with his father\u2019s ascension to the Saudi throne in 2015, he has presided over a series of destructive policies, including the Saudi-led invasion of Yemen and the kingdom\u2019s   its smaller neighbor, Qatar., Biden wanted the Saudis and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) to boost, or at least maintain, oil production in order to counter Russia\u2019s use of gas and oil as weapons in the wider east-west struggle over Putin\u2019s Ukraine invasion. very picture tells a story, or so it\u2019s said, and the photo of a smirking Vladimir Putin   with the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, at the opening game of the men\u2019s football World Cup in Moscow in June 2018 carried a clear warning for the west. Most important, the US and the western democracies must demonstrate by their actions that the great 21st-century global battle for freedom, democracy, human dignity and international law, exemplified and symbolised by the fight for Ukraine, is too vitally important, too crucial, too epic, to be bartered away for a cheap barrel of oil., For young Iranian women, Amini\u2019s death ignited an explosion of pent-up fury at the regime\u2019s suppression of women\u2019s rights. These words have become the rallying cry for protest that has erupted in the wake of the murder of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini at the hands of Iran\u2019s feared morality police. Despite the regime shutting down the internet across the country, videos of police violence continue to leak out, further fuelling public rage., The most appropriate and effective way of recognising some of the errors in awarding the football World Cup to Qatar ( ) would be to encourage players to lower their heads for a short period after the national anthems. Re the use of \u201cold age\u201d as a cause of death on the certificate ( ), I am 98 years old and when I die I hope that it will say: \u201cHeart termination.\u201d   Quite rightly, an emphasis has been placed on Covid deaths, but is it not about time we also had an inquiry into the excess deaths caused by successive Conservative governments ( )?  , Migrant workers at the Al Bayt stadium, where England will play the USA on 25 November, had been obliged to pay huge illegal recruitment fees and lived for months in unfit, overcrowded accommodation, earning \u00a31 an hour. A recent YouGov  , commissioned by Amnesty International, found huge support for a compensation fund for migrant workers who have been mistreated, and for the relatives of those who died. After prolonged hesitation, the English FA has now   the principle of a fund, as have high-profile figures in football such as the Dutch national team manager, Louis van Gaal, and the Brazil coach, Tite., The fact remains that FCDO diplomacy and humanitarian operations in places such as Afghanistan and Ukraine, UK international aid and development assistance, and the BBC\u2019s global journalism \u2013 vital soft power tools \u2013 are all struggling with financial cuts. Any such rethink should be expanded to include the   to Britain\u2019s foreign aid budget forced through by Boris Johnson and the ongoing freeze on \u201c \u201d international aid imposed when Liz Truss was foreign secretary. The decision formed part of a wider package of planned BBC World Service cuts that will also end radio broadcasts in leading languages such as Chinese, Arabic, Hindi and Indonesian., he prime minister\u2019s hour-long personal demolition derby on   on Thursday was rightly taken as an occasion to celebrate the skills of local BBC breakfast presenters, who did a fine job of holding her to account and exposing the horrible yawning vacancies of her position. Watching the incredible courage of women cutting their hair and burning their hijabs on Iran\u2019s streets this past week   in custody of Mahsa Amini reminded me of those feather dusters; perhaps, finally, their days are numbered.   There was a kind of comedy in this at the time \u2013 the Ken Dodd feathers were employed, we were told, to indicate that this was \u201clight touch\u201d enforcement \u2013 but the spectacle was nonetheless a chilling reminder of how choices for Iranian women were ultimately so rigidly circumscribed., Considering the importance of such international forums in furthering British interests, at a time when the country has a stated goal of increasing its reach as \u201cglobal Britain\u201d, there were numerous files of great importance for the prime minister to focus upon. To move the embassy to Jerusalem would be to recognise Israel\u2019s invasion and occupation of east Jerusalem as legitimate. As such, for more than five decades, the annexation of East Jerusalem into a wider \u201cgreater Jerusalem\u201d, was rejected by all international institutions, even by Israel\u2019s allies internationally., The prime minister\u2019s remarks came on the sidelines of the UN general assembly meeting where Yair Lapid voiced support for a two-state solution \u2013 the first Israeli prime minister to do so since 2017. East Jerusalem has been considered occupied territory under international law since the six-day war in 1967, and the future capital of a Palestinian state. While it may have been intended to sweeten his message on Iran, most have seen it in the context of   \u2013 Israel\u2019s fifth in less than four years, and once again shaping up as a contest for and against former prime minister   (currently favoured by polls)., Despite western leaders\u2019 reluctance to get involved in Iranian women\u2019s struggle while entering more negotiations with Iran about a nuclear deal, some new developments, such as the US government\u2019s   on internet technologies, might be the beginning of the expansion of internet freedom in Iran. If George Floyd\u2019s killing highlighted the structural racism prevalent in US society, and   in Tunisia paved the way for the arrival of an unforeseen Arab spring across the region, Amini\u2019s death has led to the bursting open of 44 years of Iranian women\u2019s struggle against unjust laws and lack of control over their bodies and sexuality. The national information network makes it possible to divide Iranian cyberspace into two parallel universes: a national network and a global one \u2013 which, to the average user, look strikingly similar., If the embassy move went ahead, it would help to bury the notion, accepted even by past Israeli leaders such as Ehud Barak, Ehud Olmert and, before he reversed his position of less than 15 years ago, by Lapid himself, of a division of Jerusalem into two capitals, Israeli and Palestinian, side by side. The refusal to station an embassy in Jerusalem ahead of a just peace between   and the Palestinians is in keeping with international law and every UN resolution over five decades calling for an end to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. Beyond that, it would directly help to empower the Israeli right in their relentless extension of illegal settlements not only in East Jerusalem but across the West Bank, corralling and dispossessing Palestinians in the process., Forty-three years ago, the Shah was ousted not just by Khomeini and his clique of radical clerics, but by a broad coalition of opposition groups, which mobilised diverse constituencies: secular urban liberals, old-school communists, new left fedayeen, Islamo-Marxist guerrillas and nationalists who venerated the memory of Mohammed Mosaddegh, the prime minister deposed in 1953 in a coup backed by the US and Britain. in Tehran and other Iranian cities following the death on 16 September of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, arrested by the morality police, who accused her of breaking laws on wearing the hijab introduced by Khomeini\u2019s regime in 1981. Witnesses of the unrest in Iran in 1978 and 1979 included Rzyard Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski, the celebrated Polish journalist, who described one massive march in Tehran as \u201ca human river, broad and boiling, flowing endlessly, rolling through the main street from dawn till dusk., This grim sequence of events, while predictable, is both infuriating and distressing, primarily for Amini\u2019s family, but also for all those in Iran seeking to build an open society where human rights, and   in particular, are respected. Marchers at state-organised   demand the execution of \u201coffenders of the Qur\u2019an\u201d while Tehran\u2019s misnomered intelligence ministry slanders protesters as seditionists opposed to religious values. Notorious examples include the atrocious treatment meted out to the women\u2019s rights defender,  , use of torture and hostage-taking affecting dual nationals., This week I was filming interviews with Nepali workers who had been sent home from Qatar recently, as companies wrap up construction projects on the eve of the  . A day of manual labour in Nepal can earn as little as 400 rupees (\u00a32.75), and so even Qatar\u2019s paltry minimum wage, equivalent to about \u00a38 a day, appears attractive. Under Qatari employment law, foreign workers have the right to change jobs if their contract is terminated and legal procedures are in place if an employee does not receive their wages or allowances at the end of their contract., The images are both stirring and moving: a mother, defiantly unveiling beside young daughters; hijab-wearers standing with those consigning their scarves to the flames; women taking to the streets despite facing brutal beatings, teargas and armed police. Yet protesters\u2019 cries of \u201cwomen, life, freedom\u201d go beyond the initial complaint to other concerns about liberty and rights, and a broader sense of injustice \u2013 US sanctions have ravaged the economy and, as everywhere, when poverty hits, women have suffered most. Iran has a long history of ruling on what women can wear: in the 1930s, prohibiting the hijab; after 1979\u2019s revolution, making it mandatory., Western sources  the Turks\u2019 claims, the Bethnal Green girls disappeared into clutches of IS, and British   chided the police for wasting time on these willing \u201cin-house whores\u201d for IS, demanding that the authorities turn their energies back to the safety of \u201c  girls\u201d.   The writer, Richard Kerbaj, notes that al-Rashed told his handler about the girls only after they had crossed the Syrian border, when it was no longer possible to stop them, but claims Canada asked Britain to cover up its role in the operation and that British authorities went along. Canadian media   the story based on Turkish intelligence reports, suggesting that Mohammed al-Rashed was a double-agent acting as an IS people-smuggler, ferrying British nationals into IS territory and relaying their identities back to the Canadians., \u2019m an atheist but I\u2019m pretty sure I just witnessed a miracle, thanks to the Palestinian-American comic Mo Amer. I have written only a handful of articles about being Palestinian; every time I file one I have anxiety attacks for days because of the inevitable character assassinations and online trolling that occur after publication. You can\u2019t even say the P-word without it causing problems: an anchor on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation once had to apologise for using   (instead of \u201cPalestinian territories\u201d), for God\u2019s sake., Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki al-Faisal was speaking as Anthony Joshua fought Ukraine\u2019s Oleksandr Usyk in Jeddah on Sunday \u2013 and one day after the United Nations human rights office denounced the   handed to Salma al-Shehab, a PhD student at Leeds University, for sharing Twitter messages. The international horror and condemnation at Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s murder at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul did not last long, despite the CIA   that it was ordered by Mohammed bin Salman; the country\u2019s crown prince and de facto ruler   responsibility. Mr Biden, who supposedly \u201creceived commitments\u201d that the kingdom had taken measures to prevent shocking human rights abuses in future, should also call for Ms Shehab\u2019s release., The answer is that the repressive Saudi regime and its crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman (who chairs the sovereign wealth fund and is widely believed to have ordered the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi), are increasingly using international sport to launder the kingdom\u2019s dire reputation for systemic  . To protest about the wretched plight of Salma al-Shehab, a Saudi PhD student at the University of Leeds, who has been   by a secretive Saudi terrorism court for 34 years \u2013 for the \u201ccrime\u201d of using Twitter. Yet Saudi Arabia\u2019s raised international profile also means there are more platforms, and more arenas, on which to highlight its intolerance for dissent, its mistreatment of Shia Muslims like Shehab, its   and its gaping, shaming democratic deficit., She\u2019s just an ordinary person with a Twitter account who, amongst tweets about her sons, occasionally retweeted people critical of Saudi Arabia and expressed support for the women\u2019s rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul, also thrown in jail by the regime. It\u2019s not surprising that the Post led the charge on this: Post Opinions contributor Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident, was brutally assassinated nearly four years ago and a US   found that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, approved his killing. The fact that Saudi Arabia was simultaneously jailing women\u2019s rights activists and bombing Yemen to smithereens, creating one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crises, got rather less play., his was always one\u2019s worst fear for Salman Rushdie: the festival crowd, the vulnerable writer on stage, the buzz of audience anticipation, and then the horrifying irruption of senseless medieval fury. As described in  , Rushdie\u2019s memoir of the fatwa, it became a destabilising experience that took the writer into hiding with a team of special branch officers armed with sub-machine guns. Ever since the Ayatollah Khomeini\u2019s fatwa placed him under sentence of death on Valentine\u2019s day 1989, Rushdie has lived with the dread of violent Islamist retribution., It\u2019s also possible that the attempt on Rushdie\u2019s life may be linked to the US Department of Justice\u2019s extraordinary announcement last week that it was charging a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps with the use of interstate commerce facilities in   John Bolton in 2021. He was also generous in his support for other writers; as an active member of English PEN and former president of PEN America, he knew what it meant to have not only your right to speak and write curtailed, but liberty itself. Ayatollah Khomeini\u2019s death sentence against Rushdie was a turning point for freedom of expression, as Kenan Malik, the most outstanding analyst of this affair,  ., Given the nature and scale of the crimes committed in Ukraine, many more states could, and should, pursue cases that would allow survivors of sexual violence and torture, or those who lost relatives in indiscriminate attacks, or families that spent months in the basements in Mariupol, to obtain justice. Now, Ukrainian survivors of horrendous crimes committed during the Russian invasion have a unique and unprecedented opportunity to pursue justice on multiple fronts. The 2016   for crimes against humanity and war crimes, including torture, sexual slavery and rape, was the culmination of an almost two-decade quest for justice., Maybe Biden thought last week\u2019s volte-face, this mother of all U-turns, as another unlamented Middle East tyrant might have put it, would help reset US-Saudi ties, scare the Iranians \u2013 and  . \u201cWith respect to the murder of Khashoggi, I raised it at the top of the meeting, making it clear what I thought of it at the time and what I think about it now,\u201d a defensive Biden said later. When a president\u2019s  , as Biden\u2019s did last week, when most Democrats say he\u2019s too old to run again, and when inflation is driving maddened voters into the arms of opponents, the mind tends to mist up., It will gain added impetus in July when US president Joe Biden visits Israel and Saudi Arabia and comes as nuclear talks with Iran  . Tehran said last week it was  While improbable at this stage, a defusing of nuclear and Iran-Saudi tensions could have huge positive implications for Tehran\u2019s ties with Europe, the US and all its Arab neighbours. Biden will encourage normalisation of Israel-Saudi relations and seek to ease Palestinian tensions \u2013 he is due to visit the occupied West Bank., The UN needs just $20m more \u2013 chump change, in terms of international funding \u2013 to begin unloading more than a million barrels of oil from a fast-decaying tanker moored off the coast of Yemen, in the fragile ecosystem of the Red Sea. Even in crudely economic terms, $80m for the first and most crucial stage of the operation \u2013 transferring the oil to a safer ship \u2013 looks like an indisputable bargain. Around a tenth of the world\u2019s shipping goes through the Bab el-Mandeb strait, which could be hit by the spill at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars a day., Britain\u2019s two largest unions, Unite and Unison, have joined Amnesty and Human Rights Watch to   Gareth Southgate\u2019s England team to publicly back two proposals to boost migrant workers\u2019 rights in Qatar. The Guardian has reported since   on the need for action to protect migrant workers supplying the labour that fuels the ambitious \u201cnation-building\u201d programmes of Qatar and its neighbouring states. The   to award World Cup hosting rights to a searingly hot Gulf state with a poor human rights record provoked widespread bafflement, suspicion and dismay., But that will not worry the Saudis, who offered a too-tempting $4m (\u00a33.2m) in prize money to the first   individual winner from a pot worth $20m. The lure of hard cash, overriding competitive, political and ethical considerations, is what drives Salman\u2019s global soft power strategy \u2013 a strategy that is rapidly transforming, distorting, and weaponising international sport. After the Saudi journalist and regime critic, Jamal Khashoggi, was murdered in 2018, Joe Biden declared Saudi Arabia a pariah state and refused to meet Salman. The Saudi soft power strategy aims for enhanced international status, investment and influence against the backdrop of Salman\u2019s \u201cVision 2030\u201d national modernisation plan., I was happy with this choice as I had heard that the UK respects human rights and I believed I had a good chance to save my life here. It is hard to believe that the UK wants to send us to a country that we have no connection with and does not respect human rights. I crossed the Channel in a dinghy organised by the smugglers and when I arrived on 14 May I was taken to a detention centre in Bedfordshire for processing., His years-long quest to change his country\u2019s moniker to T\u00fcrkiye (pronounced Tur-key-yay) reached a   last week when the UN gave its official blessing. \u201cT\u00fcrkiye is the best representation and expression of the Turkish people\u2019s culture, civilisation and values,\u201d Erdo\u011fan declared. But   formally became the Republic of T\u00fcrkiye (T\u00fcrkiye Cumhuriyeti) after independence in 1923, following the abolition of the Ottoman sultanate., Now Putin\u2019s brutal imperialism threatens in turn to damage Trump\u2019s arch-foe \u2013 Biden \u2013 by derailing his international and domestic priorities and, if Russia wins, discrediting American global leadership. In two years\u2019 time, Trump or a Trump-endorsed Republican clone could win back the White House. While some of his problems are self-inflicted, Biden\u2019s struggle to repair the global damage wrought by Trump\u2019s four-year rampage has been made infinitely more difficult by  ., The best way I can honour Abu Aqleh\u2019s memory is to ask you to consider this: if the violence that happened at a beloved Palestinian\u2019s funeral took place when the Israeli government knew the world was watching, what do you think happens to ordinary Palestinians the rest of the time? I am Palestinian (I used to say half-Palestinian, through my father, but now I refuse to slice myself in half) and have been told this several times. When my family moved to New York when I was a kid, for example, a person on our building\u2019s board heard my dad was Palestinian and \u201cjokingly\u201d told him not to hold any terrorist meetings in the apartment., Anoosheh Ashoori, who was also detained in Iran \u2013 in his case in 2017 \u2013 and released alongside Nazanin in March has so far turned down his own invitation, calling it opportunistic, and I wondered if Nazanin felt similarly. After graciously thanking him for paying the historic \u00a3400m debt that Britain owed  , Nazanin asked why it had taken six long years to do so, adding that her interrogators had made clear from her second week in prison that this was the price of her freedom. Nazanin also asked the prime minister whether he would provide evidence to the foreign affairs select committee inquiry., Abu Aqleh\u2019s killing, likely by an Israeli sniper, the subsequent raid on her family home and the police\u2019s   prior to her funeral all point to the growing sense of impunity among Israel\u2019s decision-makers and military. The Israeli police\u2019s violent attempts to remove Palestinian flags hoisted during Abu Aqleh\u2019s funeral are merely the latest manifestation of a policy that aims to squash signs of Palestinian identity in Jersualem. Before Abu Aqleh\u2019s funeral, the Israeli police warned her family to avoid the event turning into a protest, a clear attempt to demonstrate Israeli dominance., Abu Aqleh was among a group of journalists covering a raid by the Israel Defense Forces in the West Bank city of Jenin on Wednesday when, according to the    , soldiers shot her in the head. On Friday, mourners at the funeral of Abu Aqleh \u2013 a journalist Israel accepts its soldiers might have killed \u2013   by baton-wielding police. Her Qatar-based employer accused Israeli soldiers of shooting Abu Aqleh \u201cin cold blood\u201d.","Eric Mann, the former Weatherman terrorist who recruited  at the age of 17 to train her into Marxism, later\u00a0added: \"Given the social formation of the U.S. as a settler state based on virulent white supremacy, the racialization of all aspects of political life operates as a material force in itself.\" A few months later, Marx wrote, more ominously, \"There is only one way in which the murderous death agonies of the old society and the bloody birth throes of the new society can be shortened, simplified and concentrated, and that way is revolutionary terror.\" In the economic sphere, buyer and seller haggle over a price (or in most cases, millions of buyers and sellers known abstractly as \"the market\" do) to come up with a \"market-clearing price\" that allows buyer and seller to walk away with some measure of satisfaction., The only alternative is for Israel to destroy Hamas, which not only frees Israelis from the constant fear of terror attacks but also frees Palestinians from the regime of corruption, tyranny and death that has governed the Gaza Strip since Hamas took power in 2007. We have seen countless videos of people who harbor deep resentment toward Israel and Jews angrily tearing down posters that show the faces and share the stories of innocent Americans and Israelis taken hostage by Hamas.\u00a0  Tlaib committed blood libel by falsely accusing Israel of striking a hospital, fueling the fire at the same time Jews across the world were under siege and Israel\u2019s embassies in the Middle East were being attacked.\u00a0\u00a0 , Defenders of a lack of elections have pointed to the British government\u2019s refusal to hold elections during World War II. Others have pointed to the fact that the United Kingdom did not hold elections during its involvement in World War II, and that it would be wrong to hold Ukraine to higher standards.\u00a0  Zelenskyy has argued that in the midst of war, not everyone would be able to cast their votes fairly, that soldiers might not be able to vote and that Ukraine did not have enough money to conduct elections., Large bases like Fort Liberty (formerly Fort Bragg) in North Carolina (160,640 acres), Fort Polk in Louisiana (198,000 acres), Fort Campbell in Kentucky (105,000 acres), and Fort Cavazos (formerly Fort Hood) in Texas, the largest U.S. base in the world (217,600 acres), are all options, among others.\u00a0  In the wake of the   of over 1,400 Israeli civilians, including innocent children and at least 33 American citizens, the risk Biden\u2019s irresponsible border policy presents to the domestic safety of American families is clear.\u00a0\u00a0    The former administration\u2019s \"Remain in Mexico\" policy required migrants seeking asylum to remain in Mexico until their claims were adjudicated., This is sufficient force to conduct a sustained air campaign and to prevent or respond to attacks on Americans\u2014e.g., the 2012 assault on the U.S. compound in  , which left four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador, dead. What is really needed from the U.S. is escalation dominance\u2014bold actions that will terrify the Iranians and scare them off, like when the last president whacked Qasem Soleimani, the head of the IRGC for orchestrating a campaign of attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq. Already, Iranian surrogates have launched dozens of attacks on U.S. military posts in Iraq and Syria\u2014a campaign no doubt orchestrated by the IRGC., Five Harvard faculty also issued a\u00a0statement\u00a0linking the work of \"Palestinian liberation\" to the work of decolonizing Harvard, arguing for \"a more robust commitment to teaching about Palestine, to incorporating work by Palestinians into our syllabi, to inviting Palestinian scholars and community members to speak at university events, and to supporting campus activism for Palestinian liberation.\" The media, the public, and prominent political figures condemned the students for rationalizing atrocities against innocent people, including women, children, and the elderly.  , long accustomed to toeing the radical line, hesitated for days before releasing a\u00a0generic\u00a0statement of condemnation and writing that \"no student group\u2014not even 30 student groups\u2014speaks for Harvard University or its leadership.\" In his program to \"decolonize Harvard,\" Montalvo\u00a0promoted\u00a0materials highlighting Harvard student and faculty activism against Israel\u2019s supposed \"apartheid regime\" and \"settlement enterprise.\", While the Abraham Accords may not directly mitigate the immediate crisis, they offer a long-term framework that isolates malign actors like Iran and Hamas, giving Israel strategic depth and diplomatic leverage it didn\u2019t have before. This audacious attack shines a glaring spotlight on the failures of the Biden administration\u2019s foreign policy, the unholy alliance between Iran and Hamas, and the global implications that reach as far as Beijing.\u00a0  Despite the theological divide between Iran\u2019s Shiite theocracy and Hamas\u2019 radical Sunni ideology, their common goal of annihilating Israel unites them.\u00a0 , The new Jacob had a new source of power: God. And of all the times to be given   name --   means \"God fights\" or \"God strives.\" His latest book is \" : What Jacob\u2019s Story Teaches Us About Grace, Mercy and God\u2019s Relentless Love\" (Thomas Nelson, September 12, 2023)., Death Valley experienced the highest midnight temperature ever recorded on Earth.\u00a0 Austin, San Antonio, Little Rock, Baton Rouge, Anaheim, Rapid City, Santa Fe, St. Paul, Corpus Christi, Sioux Falls, Fort Lauderdale, Reno, Helena, Grand Junction, Salt Lake City, San Juan, Tampa, Orlando, Fort Worth, Carson City, Portland \u2013 all of these cities experienced their highest temperatures on record. Dozens of locations in China experienced record-high temperatures last month, including the country\u2019s all-time temperature record of 126 degrees. Scientists look at a lot of things \u2013 gas trapped in ice, tree rings, glaciers, pollen remains, even changes in the Earth\u2019s orbit \u2013 to study the natural changes in our climate going back millions of years., Rather than hoping for Chinese cooperation on climate change, the United States should strengthen its energy security, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and safeguard its values and interests by outcompeting China in the clean energy arms race.\u00a0\u00a0  Finally, our leaders in Washington must act quickly to pass permitting reform, align our trade and energy policies with Europe, beat China in the contest to commercialize fusion energy and counter the CCP\u2019s influence in Africa and South America.\u00a0\u00a0  The only way to deny China energy superpower status is to win the clean energy arms race at home and abroad., Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has the opportunity to let the Senate take a historic vote on protecting Congress\u2019 constitutional obligation to be accountable for the men and women we send into harm's way.    This authorization was passed in the months leading up to the invasion of Iraq, giving President George W. Bush authority to use U.S. armed forces to \"defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq. The 1991 and 2002 Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMF) remain on the books \u2013 with the real possibility they will be \"repurposed\" to justify a rush to war or other military action \u2013 and should be debated and voted on by Congress.\u00a0   , Will President Joe Biden and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman be holding their noses when they meet during Biden\u2019s first trip as president to Saudi Arabia on Friday? For MBS, argues veteran Saudi expert Gregory Gause, Biden\u2019s visit will bestow the political rehabilitation he craves.   of the dramatic social and economic changes he has made as part of his Vision 2030 \u2014 letting women drive, ending their segregation in public, containing the odious religious police, allowing music concerts and cinemas, and ending at least official support for radical Islamist preachers and schools at home and abroad.\u00a0  While the Saudis might announce greater open public cooperation with Israel \u2013 say, expanding overflight rights or allowing direct flights for religious pilgrims \u2013 King Salman, the ailing, 86-year-old ruler, is unlikely to establish formal ties with Israel now as several other Arab states have done under the 2020 Abraham Accords, Trump\u2019s most notable Middle East achievement., At the same time the Russians are relying on the Biden administration to waive sanctions on billions of dollars in Russian contracts for construction in Iran. There are two things profoundly wrong with the Biden administration effort to describe a long war and a protracted conflict. Brave people will die because the Biden administration refuses to provide the tools for victory., President Biden must announce to the world our national interests and strategy to counter global authoritarians starting with the Ukraine war. The perception of Biden\u2019s weakness is palpable in part because his statements and actions are devoid of identifiable national interests when it comes to key foreign policy issues like the justification for our role in the Ukraine war.    He should explain our interests in Ukraine and link them to the shifting global environment which pits the West\u2019s liberal world community against the authoritarians \u2013 China, Russia and an assortment of autocratic regimes scattered across the globe., Obviously, there's a war underway in Ukraine, and on that basis, Zelenskyy has declared martial law, but we must tell you, there is no evidence that the opposition parties he banned were aiding Russia in its war against Ukraine.\u00a0  On the very same day that Zelenskyy shut down opposition media and all opposition political parties, professional liar and Atlantic Magazine pundit David Frum posted this on Twitter verbatim: \"Ukraine may be the first example in human history of a country that, under the pressure of war, is becoming 'more' tolerant and 'more' liberal. So, maybe you're starting to conclude these people love Zelenskyy, not because he represents the Ukrainian people, but because Zelenskyy is exactly the leader they would like to be with wildly expanded war powers to make everyone who complains shut up at gunpoint., We\u2019ve established a WhatsApp group of Jewish students, warning if we encounter protests that risk escalating from calls for Palestinian liberation to those that sound to us like a call for Jewish pain. In the days after 7 October, I walked Oxford\u2019s streets, my home away from home, overwhelmed with grief and despair for victims of Hamas\u2019s premeditated massacre, rape and torture, as well as fear for the hostages held in Gaza and my loved ones. On Instagram, a university Jewish society was  : \u201cWherever you are in the world, we will take you out of your homes and perform a dance of victory and happiness over your bodies\u201d; another was  , accompanied by a video of beheaded babies, reading: \u201cYou must be killed all of u till the last naziest of you\u201d [sic]; a   that said: \u201cYou massacred innocent Muslims, I hope you die too.\u201d, The Israel Defense Forces say that Hamas has placed command centres under and around al-Shifa and other facilities; Hamas and the hospital staff deny this. But as Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the United Nations secretary-general, warned: \u201cYou cannot use the horrific things Hamas did [on 7 October] as a reason for the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.\u201d he thousands injured by relentless airstrikes need treatment; the health of many more is deteriorating sharply due to the lack of clean water, food and medicines; others have taken shelter in medical facilities in the belief that surely there, at least, they will be safe., Ever since Israel\u2019s forces began the assault on Gaza that has killed  , according to figures released by the Hamas-controlled health authority, each protest for peace has passed off, well, peacefully. These extremists \u2013 who support Israel\u2019s onslaught \u2013  , and they understandably believe they have the tacit support of the government, given their position on the protesters is one and the same. They know that the vast majority of the British public abhorred Hamas\u2019s atrocities, and also must speak out against a humanitarian catastrophe that leaves newborn babies being incinerated by bombs and pregnant women forced to give birth without medicines or anaesthetic., Biden has spent most of his presidency   confrontation with Israeli leaders after his former boss, then president Barack Obama, was burned by his   With another presidential race against Donald Trump looming, it\u2019s difficult to imagine that Biden will be spending much political capital on the Israel-Palestinian conflict. That\u2019s a convenient narrative about a complex process that, among other things, ignores the part many people believe Netanyahu and the Israeli right played in  , who signed the Oslo accords \u2013 the first big crisis of the peace process. In the wake of the Hamas cross-border attack from Gaza, and the Israeli assault on the Palestinian enclave in response, President Joe Biden is punting the peace process back on to the agenda., Little wonder Putin calculates that American staying power will again fade as Trump, campaigning when not in court, trashes Biden\u2019s Ukraine policy and his  . Trump\u2019s uncritical, submissive, often suspiciously furtive attitude to Vladimir Putin has undermined Biden\u2019s Russia policy, doing untold, lasting harm. Yet if the Barack Obama-Biden policy of engagement, backed by Britain and the EU, had been maintained by Trump, things might be very different today, inside and outside Iran., That does not mean that Iran will launch itself into an appallingly risky war with the United States at Russia\u2019s behest, nor that Hezbollah will launch such a war against Israel at Iran\u2019s behest \u2013 though it is easy to imagine how the  occurring on the Lebanese-Israeli border could escalate to full-scale war. Witness (in a widely circulated  ) the US national security council spokesperson John Kirby choking back crocodile tears over Russian bombardment of civilians in Ukraine, then justifying Israeli \u201ccollateral damage\u201d in Gaza \u2013 although according to UN  , Israel has already killed almost as many Palestinian civilians in two weeks as Russia has killed Ukrainian civilians in 20 months. Since the invasion of Ukraine has faltered, Russia and Iran have forged a closer  , and Russia has come to increasingly depend on Iran for supplies of drones., While no one in their right mind could justify Hamas\u2019 murder of civilians on 7 October \u2013 and I have not heard a hint of this sentiment in Ireland \u2013 Ireland has a long history of supporting what is viewed as the cause of Palestinian freedom and peace in the region. n recent weeks, leaders from the  , the UK and the US have stood shoulder to shoulder with Benjamin Netanyahu, expressing support for Israel\u2019s \u201cright to defend itself\u201d, a slogan that has wreaked horror on Gaza following Hamas\u2019s horrific attack on Israeli civilians and security forces. As videos of Irish politicians   and criticising the Israeli government continue to go viral on social media, the question asked by those new to Ireland\u2019s position is simple: why?, or Palestinians in Gaza, life is endured moment to moment, not knowing whether there will be food for their children\u2019s next meal, or clean water for an ailing parent, or \u2013 with the death toll now having reached at least 8,796,   \u2013 whether their family will even survive the day. An Israeli thinktank led by former officials published (then deleted) a paper   the \u201cunique and rare opportunity to evacuate the whole Gaza Strip\u201d; a leaked report from an Israeli government research body   the forcible and permanent transfer of all 2.2\u00a0million inhabitants. If the repeated   by western leaders in recent days was partly intended to deflect criticism of their failure to condemn the enormous civilian toll of Israel\u2019s offensive, it also reflects a growing sense that there is no longer a choice., Last week a group of US senators, including Elizabeth Warren, Mazie Hirono, Ed Markey, Tina Smith, Raphael Warnock, Chris Murphy, Chris Van Hollen, Jeff Merkley, Peter Welch and Bernie Sanders,   a joint call for a humanitarian pause, saying that \u201cthe war in Gaza has become a humanitarian crisis and has claimed the lives of innocent Palestinians \u2026 On 16 October,  , led by the representatives Cori Bush and Rashida Tlaib, announced a resolution \u201curging the Biden administration to call for an immediate de-escalation and ceasefire in Israel and occupied Palestine, to send humanitarian aid and assistance to Gaza, and to save as many lives as possible\u201d. To progressives, a humanitarian ceasefire or pause would also afford a moment that we hope can build momentum for further multilateral diplomacy that ultimately brings an end to both Israel\u2019s imprisonment of Palestinian civilians in Gaza and Hamas\u2019s Gaza-based offensive capability., It may even be a first step to stilling the Gaza slaughter, to Hamas releasing the 229 hostages, to no more rocket attacks on Israel, to Hamas releasing the   it keeps shut in Gaza, including 600 Americans and 200 British people. Starmer is not playing politics with this \u2013 unlike Tory backbenchers howling gleeful accusations that if any Labour MP makes a \u201cceasefire\u201d call it will revive Labour antisemitism. Lib Dems likewise use their \u201cceasefire\u201d stance for gain, suddenly appearing in force in Labour seats with significant Muslim communities, according to some Labour MPs., The Hamas terrorists who killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians, in southern Israel on 7 October claim to be fighting back in northern Gaza after Israel targeted their underground tunnels. Hamas is continuing to fire off rockets and use civilians as shields while trying to lure Israeli forces into lethal urban combat; Israel, meanwhile, has shown scant interest so far in taking up any of these suggestions. Yet how are the Hamas killers to be captured or eliminated without causing the deaths of many more Palestinian civilians, of people who have no control or say over Hamas\u2019s actions and whose lives, too, are precious?, Israel\u2019s refusal to allow adequate supplies of humanitarian aid and water or any fuel into Gaza, lack of help for the wounded, disputed tragedies like the Al-Ahli   and the widespread belief that Israel is breaking international law are all turning opinion hostile. Iran\u2019s threats to activate its region-wide \u201caxis of resistance\u201d, the advance of allied Iraqi and Syrian Shia militias towards Israel\u2019s borders, attacks launched from Yemen, rising violence in the   and a deepening standoff with   intensify the sense of an Israel under siege on all sides. These four interconnected crises \u2013 the intensifying war, domestic political strife, a losing global PR battle and the intractable hostage dilemma \u2013 are exacerbating a fifth: the long-term strategic, some would say existential crisis confronting Israel., So strong is the allegiance to their chosen side \u2013 their team \u2013 that at a home game on the afternoon of 7 October, hours after the men of Hamas had begun their massacre of civilians in southern Israel, and while the torture and murder of families in their homes was still under way, a group of Celtic fans  . It ends in a group of terrified Jewish students  of New York\u2019s Cooper Union college, fleeing a group of masked protesters chanting \u201cFree Palestine\u201d \u2013 their pursuers doubtless convinced they are warriors for justice and liberation, rather than the latest in a centuries-long line of mobs hounding Jews. Many millions around the world watch the Israel-Palestine conflict in the same way: as a binary contest in which you can root for only one team, and where any losses suffered by your opponent \u2013 your enemy \u2013 feel like a win., So it is a sad commentary on the polarised times we live in that this week, the UN security council could not even  that provides explicit safeguards for the rights of children currently caught up in the conflict, reinforcing a perception that the international community is as powerless to protect children in Israel and Gaza as it has been in a succession of tragedies in Yemen, Sudan, Myanmar and Ukraine. And with only an estimated   supplies getting through to children in Gaza and   available, a charter protecting the rights of children should urgently ensure that talk of \u201c \u201d or \u201clulls\u201d or \u201cwindows\u201d really means unimpeded humanitarian access to address the current emergencies. Indeed, not much has changed since 1996, when Gra\u00e7a Machel\u2019s report to the UN general assembly on children in conflict spoke of \u201ca space devoid of the most basic human values \u2026 a space in which children are slaughtered\u201d., This week Gilad Erdan, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the UN, furiously accused the organisation of becoming a \u201cstain on humanity\u201d after its secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, declared that while nothing could justify the 7 October massacre perpetrated by Hamas, the attacks \u201c \u201d. But advocates of crushing Hamas in a ground war must equally acknowledge that Palestinians cannot simply carry on living afterwards in hopeless misery, or a new Hamas will eventually emerge to feed off that enduring pain and the cycle will begin again. But so do those who will have felt a strange relief at hearing someone in power articulate what is on one level a statement of the obvious \u2013 that like all terrorist organisations, Hamas feeds off an existing wellspring of pain, even as its own actions only worsen Gaza\u2019s desperate poverty and vulnerability \u2013 and yet has felt unsayable., They included a US-sponsored motion   that, though heavily revised following consultations, called for a humanitarian pause rather than a ceasefire, and a Russian-drafted one that did not mention Israel\u2019s right to self-defence (and which, despite Moscow\u2019s hideous record, piously condemned violence against civilians). The secretary general unequivocally condemned the horrific attacks by Hamas on 7 October, which left at least 1,400 dead in southern  , said that nothing could justify the deliberate harming of civilians and urged the release of the more than 200 hostages reportedly held by Hamas. The Israeli ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, turned on the secretary general so strongly that the criticism, rather than the plight of civilians in Gaza and growing calls for a ceasefire, dominated headlines., Before 7 October, Gaza received some 500 trucks of food and other supplies every day, including 45 trucks of fuel to power the strip\u2019s cars, water desalination plants and bakeries. An immediate humanitarian ceasefire must be enacted to allow safe, continuous and unrestricted access to fuel, medicine, water and food in the Gaza Strip. Nearly 600,000 people are sheltering in 150 schools and other UNRWA buildings, living in unsanitary conditions with limited clean water, little food and medicines., A poll for campaigners Avaaz   this week that 57% of Israelis \u201csupport a plan where Hamas will release the children and families it holds hostage, in exchange for the Israeli government releasing Palestinian children held in Israeli jails\u201d. Hamas\u2019 war crimes against Israeli civilians do not justify Israeli forces committing war crimes against Palestinian civilians. hen 85-year-old Israeli Yocheved Lifshitz was released from Hamas\u2019s underground cells, she was filmed gripping the hand of a hooded fighter who had probably been part of her prison guard while saying \u201c \u201d, the Hebrew word for peace., He spent an hour with the Israeli leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, and visited Riyadh and Cairo; he met the emir of Qatar and the leader of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas. This came on top of Sunak\u2019s  , including a hospital ship, and a unit of marines, to \u201csupport efforts to ensure regional stability and prevent further escalation\u201d. Last week, assailed by two  , Rishi Sunak sought consolation on the red carpets of Riyadh, Cairo and Tel Aviv., The US, Israel\u2019s point of leverage in the region, is no longer as influential as it was \u2013 a combination of a sclerotic Middle East policy, high energy prices dropping a confidence-boosting windfall to oil- and gas-producing countries, and decreased distracting tensions within and between Arab countries themselves, diminishing the need for the US\u2019s security profile in the region. Bombing Gaza, cutting it off and lashing out, has drawn not just the ire of the \u201cArab street\u201d, too easily disregarded as a place of regular futile flag-burning anger, but also global human rights   in New York and London, which now accuse Israel of  . The protests are increasingly an immersive cathartic state of mourning for all the losses that many have to reconcile themselves with; the weakness and lack of solidarity and compact between a large bloc of countries that have chosen to pursue self-interest rather than pan-Arabism, the dearth of democracy in the region, and the lack of dignity and human rights that comes with it., Like numerous diplomats and politicians in the Arab world, Europe and the US, Guterres is working frantically to prevent the fire lit on 7 October from spreading beyond the besieged Palestinian enclave of Gaza, where Hamas is based, to the wider region. He urged Netanyahu to think through his objectives in Gaza, and what Israel\u2019s postwar strategy would be, before committing his forces to a protracted battle with Hamas. Such a ceasefire, he says, would provide sufficient time to secure the unconditional release of all hostages held in Gaza while allowing unrestricted access for aid supplies., Israel\u2019s war cabinet has set four objectives for \u201cOperation Swords of Iron\u201d: destroying Hamas militarily, eliminating the terrorist threat in Gaza, resolving the hostage crisis, and defending state borders and citizens. In the UN security council, tattered guardian of outraged international law, France and everyone else backed a draft resolution to pause hostilities and overturn Israel\u2019s evacuation order in northern Gaza. Visitors  and Germany\u2019s Olaf Scholz, sandwiching Biden, played to audiences at home and, gentle words of caution aside, otherwise played along with Netanyahu., The Palestinian Authority, the Israeli occupation\u2019s subcontractor in the West Bank, cracks down on dissent with the same enthusiasm as Israel, with journalists and activists  Just this week, Palestinian Authority security forces   in Jenin and injured dozens of people across the West Bank after opening fire on protesters who came out in support of Gaza. In the first eight months of 2023, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) recorded a daily average of   a day on Palestinians in the West Bank, killing and injuring Palestinians, damaging their property, and preventing them from moving to reach their lands, workplaces, families and friends. Israeli settlers opened fire at residents and rather than hold them back, as Israeli forces claim to do, they joined in.   were killed that day, with settlers killing three and soldiers killing one., Even before the Hamas-led 7 October  , warning signs were already blinking red \u2013 a track record of unlawful attacks by   and  ,   and   against Palestinians,   by Israeli officials and   of attacks on civilians by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups. he image of haggard doctors   amid bodies and rubble following   on al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza has sent shock waves around the world, which was still reeling from   Hamas-led attacks and the relentless Israeli bombardment and siege of Gaza. Talking to Israeli partners and friends, almost everyone knows someone either killed when Hamas-led fighters shot civilians en masse, took hostages into Gaza or who   onslaught by barricading themselves for hours as militants hunted civilians in their homes., Egypt\u2019s treatment of Palestinians entering and exiting Gaza is notorious for its indignity \u2013 the latest iteration being Palestinians who tried to enter Gaza only to find the border closed on 7 October,  ; they are being hosted by families who are under strict security instructions not to allow them to leave the neighbourhoods where they reside. After the   (the six-day war, in which Israeli forces captured East Jerusalem and the Palestinian territories, including Gaza), the  , drafted by Israeli politician Yigal Allon, envisioned the Gaza Strip being annexed to Israel. In an  , Israel\u2019s former ambassador to the US, Danny Ayalon, said: \u201cThe people of Gaza should evacuate and go to the vast expanses on the other side of Rafah at the Sinai border in Egypt \u2026 and Egypt will have to accept them.\u201d, Representative Nancy Pelosi, our California congresswoman, has   that the United States stands \u201cunwaveringly\u201d by Israel as it conducts its defense \u2013 which is why seven of us   on Friday as more than 200 anti-Zionist Jews rallied, calling for an end to US military aid to Israel. Forced displacement, which Israel has begun, is an established precursor to extermination \u2013 one of the final steps, in fact, in the   cited internationally by genocide scholars and institutions, including by Holocaust museums      . Israeli officials are invoking terrorism to justify their indiscriminate bombing campaign, while the Israeli defense minister said that they are fighting   \u2013 dehumanising language that is always used in the lead-up to genocide., Unfortunately, many others are suffering a similar fate: many of the hostages taken have suffered grave injuries, including gunshot wounds and limb loss during the attack; others have cancer, Parkinson\u2019s disease and other serious medical conditions; several children have special needs; and at least one nine-month-old baby needs formula to stay alive, according to a medical report that a group representing the hostages\u2019 families presented to the International Red Cross, which is demanding access to the hostages. In a panic, Adva drove to Tamar\u2019s apartment, took her iPad and with the help of friends managed to trace her sister\u2019s phone \u2013 which hadn\u2019t moved from its location since 8.11am that morning. We know the UK government and others are supporting Israel, but we urge them to step up efforts to bring the hostages home to Israel \u2013 and at the very least make sure they are getting medical care they desperately need., The threat in northern Gaza is plenty real as Israeli bombers   neighborhoods in attacks that appear designed less to pinpoint Hamas fighters than to collectively punish the civilian population of Gaza \u2013 the same population that has endured years of Hamas\u2019s military dictatorship and had no say in Hamas\u2019s decision to slaughter Israeli civilians. The order requires 1.1 million people to flee their homes in northern Gaza in advance of an imminent Israeli ground invasion \u2013 the next step in the Israeli response to the horrendous Hamas massacre and abduction of Israeli civilians on 7 October. If the point is to \u201c \u201d, as the Israeli interior minister, Gila Gamliel, says, it hardly takes a brilliant strategist to figure out that, while parts of Hamas will fight Israeli forces in northern Gaza, other parts will deploy in the south., It remains to be seen if that is Israel\u2019s plan after it ordered more than one million people to get out of northern Gaza as the military prepares further attacks in addition to the bombing and shelling that has already killed 2,700 Palestinians, including 700 children. In different ways, the sentiment that the Palestinians are collectively responsible for the actions of Hamas in killing of about 1,300 Israelis and  of 199 \u2013 and therefore deserve what is coming to them \u2013 has been echoed far beyond Israel\u2019s borders. For years, Israeli leaders have advocated ethnic cleansing, euphemistically called \u201ctransfer\u201d, with a discourse that portrays Palestinians as a fake people with no history that matters., The words that  , then head of the Palestine Red Crescent in Gaza, addressed to the Israeli people 32 years ago at the Madrid peace conference came suddenly to mind: \u201cWe, the people of Palestine, stand before you in the fullness of our pain, our pride and our anticipation, for we have long harboured a yearning for peace and a dream of justice and freedom.\u201d And yet almost immediately after signing the agreement, Israel pursued a policy of severing ties between the West Bank and Gaza, and each from Israel, for example by making   increasingly difficult for Palestinians and Israelis. I have heard the Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, say that his country is fighting against \u201c \u201d, and I have seen the aftermath of the indiscriminate killings of civilians committed by Hamas militants in southern Israel., Even so, Biden seems to think he can win Israeli agreement for increased Palestinian autonomy, a halt to West Bank annexation plans and maybe a revived two-state peace process in return for delivering the Saudis, defanging   and providing security guarantees all round. After the  , Biden   The answer is that normalisation would represent a big pre-election win for the president, especially when linked to the third leg of his plan: advancing Palestinian statehood. Since taking office in 2021, US president  , mindful of recent, scarring American calamities and preoccupied by China and Ukraine, has mostly steered clear of continuing crises in the West Bank, Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Libya and Sudan., The sportswashing efforts of various Middle Eastern regimes \u2013 the Qatar World Cup, grands prix in Bahrain,   and, most visibly, the takeovers of football clubs by various sovereign wealth funds \u2013 have been pored over and criticised, but pop\u2019s involvement in cultural reputation-laundering has been largely ignored. Pop still likes to think of itself as countercultural (despite decades of evidence to the contrary, such as numerous corporate tie-ins), so it tends to align with causes perceived as being leftwing \u2013 and there\u2019s no firmer signifier of your leftwingness than wanting to boycott Israel in support of Palestine. Or take the 1975, a band I think are great,   only to play festival bills with a gender-balanced lineup, yet still last year  , a festival   for the maleness of its lineups., \u201cThe outbreak of fighting in Sudan should give world leaders pause: it threatens to be the latest in a wave of devastating wars in  , the Middle East, and South Asia that over the past decade have ushered in a new era of instability and strife,\u201d the independent International Crisis Group warned recently. It damages countries whose path to prosperity, democracy and human rights is uncertain and   Each time Trump sets himself above the law, a dictator in Africa or Asia cheers. While Trump was fulminating about the unfairness of it all and Johnson was whingeing to his mates, hundreds of terrified,   were spilling over the border into Chad \u2013 victims of an unfolding regional catastrophe., Wars on Human Health, published by the Costs of War project at Brown University\u2019s Watson Institute, focuses on what she terms \u201cindirect deaths\u201d \u2013 caused not by outright violence but by consequent, ensuing economic collapse, loss of livelihoods, food insecurity, destruction of public health services, environmental contamination and continuing trauma, including mental health problems, domestic and sexual abuse and displacement. \u201cAbdoulaye is doubly uncounted: as a displaced person and as a war death,\u201d writes Stephanie Savell, a cultural anthropologist, recalling his brief life in a disturbing new report that reveals the vast, unacknowledged human costs of contemporary global warfare. Calculated this way, the total number of deaths that occurred as a result of post-9/11 warfare in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Libya and Somalia rises dramatically from an upper estimate of 937,000 to at least  , of which up to 3.6 million were \u201cindirect deaths\u201d., If Saudi-Houthi talks make progress, Riyadh says the next step will be talks between the Houthis and the Presidential Leadership Council (PLC), to which President Hadi ceded his powers. Yet, since the agreement of a truce between the Saudi-led military coalition and Iran-backed Houthi rebels  , the country has seen a year of relative calm. Riyadh spearheaded the coalition supporting the internationally recognised government led by Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which had been ousted by the Houthis., It is true that there have been some tame expressions of concern from Sunak\u2019s government about the current Israeli government, and the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has confirmed that the UK government is   with the Israeli minister of national security,  , a far-right activist within the  . Yet rather than treating the Israeli government accordingly, the UK government has signed a \u201croadmap for UK-Israeli bilateral relations\u201d, committing to various aspects of economic and state partnership. Since the new government was sworn in, as reported by international governments, lawyers and human rights groups, Israel has  \u201d of occupied land and advanced construction in  .   have been killed by Israeli forces (as of 13 March); last year,   Palestinians were killed in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, including nearly 40 children., China complained at the UN that   the nuclear non-proliferation treaty by transferring fissile material and nuclear technology to a non-nuclear weapons state. For his part, Xi can point to continuing US and UK nuclear weapons modernisation, and to last week\u2019s deal to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines. In other words, at the very moment when the Kremlin is under unprecedented pressure and US-Russia relations are at their most tense since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, the political channels, agreed mechanisms and binding limits that could help avoid a nuclear collision are less robust and dependable than ever before., When examined together, the is currently legislating have one simple meaning (and you don\u2019t need a PhD in law to get it): if these laws are passed, the government will have the power to completely destroy our freedom.  of Knesset [ ] could pass any racist, oppressive and anti-democratic law they think of; 61 members of Knesset could also change the electoral system, to stop us from replacing the regime. Democracy is a deal, according to which citizens must respect the government\u2019s decisions, on the condition that the government respects the basic liberties of the citizens. When we ask the leaders of this coup what will keep the power of the government in check under the new regime, and what will protect basic human rights, they only have one answer: \u201ctrust us\u201d., In Iran, whose post-1979 democratic system is crumbling, Mojtaba Khamenei, son of the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is mentioned as a possible successor.  , President Daniel Ortega and his vice-president wife, Rosario Murillo, the world\u2019s most notorious revolutionary apostates, are said to be prepping their son, Laureano Ortega,  . The son of the Dear Leader, Kim Jong-il, and grandson of North Korea\u2019s founding father, Kim Il-sung, was clearly indicating that talk of regime change is pointless. Earlier this month, Kim Jong-un, North Korea\u2019s dictator, used an anniversary parade of long-range ballistic missiles as the intimidating backdrop for a sort of coming-out party for his  , who is thought to be 10 years old., Given the UAE\u2019s huge investment in oil and gas, it was always likely that there would be serious tensions at Cop28 between action on climate and the fossil-fuel industry. The 2023 climate conference, Cop28, will be held a few weeks before Christmas in the United Arab Emirates, and the fossil-fuel lobby already knows it is getting the best present it could ever wish for. Continuing with the status quo will do nothing less than cement the fossil-fuel takeover of the Cop process and ensure that the industry continues to get away with murder., Violence involving the Israeli army, Jewish settlers and Palestinians  Sign up to  Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Iran is near boiling point, too, owing to sweeping anti-government protests \u2013 and because nuclear talks with the west face imminent collapse.   The same factors that have induced South Korea and other regional countries to raise their game militarily, prompted the formation of  ( the Australia, UK and US security pact) and are feeding deeper cooperation within   (the US, India, Japan and Australia). Benny Gantz, Israel\u2019s outgoing defence minister, last week predicted further, bloody escalation in the occupied West Bank resulting from prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s decision   to his anti-Arab coalition partners., Unlike in my youth, when they meant discovering players from different lands, today\u2019s World Cups are essentially contests between players from European clubs who know each other well and often play for the same team. The other is of the  , Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, putting the traditional Arab men\u2019s cloak, the black  , round Messi, just before he receives the trophy. These self-appointed guardians of the game, who for decades have feasted on venality, continue to make promises they know they cannot fulfil, and instead use the wonders of Messi and others to validate themselves., In the subsequent years, with the formation of a Sudanese religious police in the early 90s, the spaces of relative freedom in which my mother had once dressed had closed up. In recent years, social media has created space for women to form positive communities. She was left a little lost for words as she tried to explain how the cultural and religious climate in Sudan had changed over the years., I never got to the stage of needing a drink to go to the shops, but I was most definitely at the stage when an evening with a dear friend wouldn\u2019t hold much appeal if there wasn\u2019t going to be drink involved. There should be a special place in fools\u2019 hell for people who spend so much time and money getting to a football match, only to miss their team\u2019s only goal because their bladder is full. On the other hand, there is the delicious possibility of England winning this World Cup roared on by sober fans, whose delight will be diminished not a jot by the absence of alcohol., In retrospect, it does seem that the whole idea of annual climate carnivals was probably not the best means of promoting serious action on global heating, but their hijacking by the fossil fuel sector, and failure, year on year, to do the job they were set up to do, surely means that Cop is no longer fit for purpose. The all-encompassing nature of the annual Cop climate conference provides one enormous open goal for fossil fuel representatives; an unprecedented opportunity to kettle ministers and heads of state from every corner of the planet, but particularly the  , to browbeat them into handing over their untouched fossil fuel reserves for exploitation. What is needed is an apparatus that is less cumbersome and more manageable \u2013 something leaner and meaner that zeros in on the most critical aspects of the climate crisis, that does its work largely hidden from the glare of the media, and which presents a less obvious honey pot to the busy bees of the fossil fuel sector., It would be easy to be churlish about this, given it follows reports that   was planning to go and hog the limelight instead, while doubtless giving the impression of caring so very much more deeply about the planet than his successor (imagine being out-serioused by Johnson, who made   during a rambling keynote address last year to the UN on the climate emergency, and a U-turn becomes easier to understand). The ejection of another toxic populist \u2013 Jair Bolsonaro goes the way of Donald Trump and Australia\u2019s culture warrior Scott Morrison, hopefully quietly \u2013 and the return of Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva despite a corruption scandal some thought had finished him does at least bring some hope for the survival of the Amazon rainforest. Perhaps the best lesson an inexperienced prime minister could draw meanwhile from the   episode is that always prioritising today\u2019s urgent problem (in this case the budget) over tomorrow\u2019s more distant but more existential one (the prospect of the entire planet frying) is roughly how we ended up in this burning mess., The protests set alight by the death of the 22-year-old Kurdish woman have persisted and thrived despite the regime\u2019s brutality, and have gone far beyond women\u2019s rights. EU sanctions imposed on Monday will be limited in effect, but at least have the merit of being targeted at the morality police or leading figures in the regime. The population longs for social and political freedoms, and endures dire economic straits caused by corruption, incompetence and the punitive sanctions imposed by the west but brought on them too by their leaders., Further examination of my devices showed not only tracking by NSO\u2019s spyware, but also evidence that another spyware, Cellebrite, was implanted on my devices and downloaded all my communications with Jamal. In 2019, Dr Agn\u00e8s Callamard, the former UN special rapporteur who  , asked for his devices and was told by Turkish authorities that they were holding Jamal\u2019s phones and his computer as part of their investigation, and the examination of those devices were \u201congoing\u201d. I believe those devices will reveal previously undisclosed details about Jamal\u2019s murder that are critical to knowing the full truth and advancing the cause of justice., Americans, too, should be deeply suspicious of Tehran\u2019s intentions, suggested Iran expert Karim Sadjadpour \u2013 because Khamenei\u2019s grip on power, and that of the illegitimate elite surrounding him, pivots on unceasing confrontation with the Great Satan. Hosting Vladimir Putin in Tehran last month, Khamenei claimed that, just as with Iran, the west and Nato opposed a \u201cstrong, independent Russia\u201d. \u201cThe policies that ... Khamenei has championed for three decades have pushed Iran to the brink of total economic and ecological collapse and, despite staging brutal crackdowns, the country is wallowing in social unrest ..., This week President Biden announced an executive order declaring hostage diplomacy  , calling for sanctions against those taking US citizens hostage, and designating states where it occurs. Behind closed doors we discussed how solving hostage-taking requires a carrot and stick: carrots to get people home, sticks to deter the hostage-takers. The names came from evidence identifying 10 Iranian officials submitted to Truss last September, requesting that they be sanctioned for their role in Iran\u2019s hostage industry., According to the International Federation of Journalists, Israeli forces have killed   Palestinian journalists  , while Palestinian ministry of health data records 50 Palestinians killed in 2022  . This is why Shireen\u2019s killing during an Israeli raid on a refugee camp in Jenin shook all Palestinians to the core. What has made it all the worse is the Israeli propaganda machine, which swung into action as soon as news broke of Shireen\u2019s killing.","You\u2019ll hear a lot about that foundation myth today and how the human \u201closs\u201d and \u201csacrifice\u201d (331,000 Australians deployed; 60,000 killed; 155,000 wounded) was   seminal event upon which the new Australian federation was built, Australia having followed an empire into its first major war of too many to come. I fear that after the referendum campaign \u2013 whose more negative proponents boldly, falsely   colonialism was not detrimental to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people \u2013 an even greater inertia will befall, and more deliberate obstacles impede, the official memorialisation of Australia\u2019s true and complex war history. The Middle East and all of the dominoes that line up correspondingly behind Israel, and Arab, Muslim and other opponents of the Gaza invasion (for all the ongoing war\u2019s  ), compounds a global trauma already experienced over Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine., Given the desperate humanitarian situation in Gaza, given Israeli forces are closing in on the centre of Gaza City, given the death toll has now reached more than 10,000 people, including more than 4,000 children, given   have been a while coming \u2013 Australian Palestinian communities in Labor\u2019s electoral heartland are also in a state of acute despair. When Albanese went to thank members of the Islamic community for supporting the recognition of Australia\u2019s First Nations peoples, the prime minister said he had recently heard a teacher explaining why it was important for Muslims to be an ally for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Before Albanese departed for China last week, protesters in Melbourne were  : \u201cAlbanese blood on your hands\u201d, \u201cAlbanese can\u2019t hide, you\u2019re supporting genocide\u201d, \u201cAlbo, you coward, blood on your hands.\u201d, Rachel has undertaken a PhD on palliative care in Gaza and has been supporting the development of palliative care Dr Mhoira Leng is a Scottish palliative care physician with experience in clinical teaching and in supporting global health and palliative care development across Africa, India and in Gaza We are palliative care practitioners who were scheduled to be in Gaza this week to support palliative care education and mentoring of undergraduate medical students and postgraduate healthcare professionals. Palliative care is care \u2013 social, emotional, spiritual and physical \u2013 for a person and their family affected by serious illness and those at the end of their life, and bereavement care after somebody has died., And it will require Israel to stop establishing settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories \u2013 that even the divided UN security council agreed is a \u201cflagrant violation\u201d of international law and a \u201cmajor obstacle\u201d to peace.    So when Israel\u2019s friends urge Israel to exercise restraint and protect civilian lives, it is critical that Israel listens. Supporting civilians, helping prevent conflict from spreading, and reinforcing the need for a durable peace \u2013 all of which we pursue by working with countries that have influence in the region., Not only have we been able to support organisations providing direct assistance to the communities impacted by this horrific and senseless violence but we are also funding our incredible grantee organisations paving the pathway for a shared future, grounded in justice, respect and collective responsibility, like the Tzedek Centres, a network of social justice centres led by Jews and Palestinian citizens of Israel. Sign up to  Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion As Jess Bricker of Standing Together, a grassroots organisation led by Jews and Palestinians, said at a briefing to our community last week: \u201cI think what we\u2019re seeing on social media is that people are being led to believe that they need to side with states and not with people \u2026 We need to build the front that is fighting for people. We have also seen the argument made that Palestinians support the attacks on Israelis because they voted for Hamas, although the elections where Hamas took power took place 17 years ago, when the majority of residents in Gaza were below voting age and, even then, less than 50% of Palestinians voted for Hamas., In the upheaval that is unfolding as the result, Enas is now one of countless displaced Palestinian residents of Gaza; having heeded Israel\u2019s warnings and moved from her Gaza City home to an uncertain future in the south. very Sunday since October 2021, Dr Enas, a passionate physician from Gaza City, has bid farewell to her two sons to embark on a journey to Wolfson hospital in Holon,  . Numerous Palestinian families in Gaza, especially those with critically ill children requiring specialised treatments such as chemotherapy and paediatric dialysis, are caught in this crossfire., While the Labor government is right to break away from previous governments, which failed to implement Australia\u2019s commitment to international law and the two-state solution, Labor has a chance to take a real and decisive step in upholding its values by voting to recognise the state of Palestine at its national conference this month. Given the urgency of the Israeli government and its unfolding extremist agenda Israel needs Australia and its allies to help protect the democratic vision of its founding fathers, as enshrined in Israel\u2019s 1948 declaration of independence. The Benjamin Netanyahu-led ultranationalist government is racing towards annexation of the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT), a manoeuvre which will not only end any chance of a two-state outcome, but also permanently entrench the daily humanitarian and anti-democratic nightmare that the Israeli occupation has become., But if the Australian government believes it has a duty to repatriate children born in Syria to Australian mothers then it equally has a right to at least offer that option to the children born in Syria to Australian fathers. Advocacy groups such as   have been vocal in calling for the repatriation of children born to Australian mothers, but silent on what to do with children born to Australian fathers. Children born to an Australian parent are, on the face of it, eligible for Australian citizenship as long as the child\u2019s parentage can be proven and one parent was an Australian citizen at the time the child was born., Soon temperatures in the camps will reach near freezing, and I fear that if the remaining children are not rescued soon, we could see another death, as was seen earlier this year with the   of 17-year-old Australian boy Yusuf Zahab. Over the past year, I\u2019ve interviewed and surveyed family members, teachers, social workers, and mental health professionals about approximately 100 children repatriated from the camps who are now living in western Europe and central Asia. The squalid, locked camps where these children were detained still hold about 38,000 foreign nationals, mostly the wives and children of male IS suspects., The Iranian women\u2019s revolution has tapped into a collective struggle for women across the globe as we continue to face issues of equality and fairness, such as a continued lack of representation in all levels of government and business; the gender pay gap; and most concerning, the continued erosion of women\u2019s rights in places such as Afghanistan, India and even the US. As members of the UN Commission on the Status of Women, with a strong international standing and a large Iranian diaspora, our response needs to be commensurate with our commitment to protect the universality of human rights and the promotion and progress of social inclusion by ensuring equal rights for women and young girls. Action by the Australian government will send a clear message not only to the Iranian regime, that we are watching and questioning their legitimacy to govern Iran, but also to all migrants who lovingly call Australia home, that they matter and that our government will not remain a spectator while humans suffer., What started as a mass uprising condemning the killing under police custody of 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian Mahsa Amini for a dress code violation has now amalgamated into widespread calls for a complete regime change in Tehran. The Australian government has joined others, including Germany, the UK, US, Canada, Austria and Spain in condemning the Iranian regime for its treatment of protesters. These protests are historically unique for Iran: this is the  , with Iranian men standing shoulder to shoulder with valiant Iranian women.","What Putin can do is leverage his relationship with Iran and Syria, and Russia\u2019s contacts with Hamas, to insert Russia into the peace process in the Middle East. Feting Hamas just weeks after its terrorist raid on Israel is part and parcel of Vladimir Putin\u2019s deliberate strategy of bolstering Russia\u2019s waning influence in the Middle East. After the Soviet Union\u2019s allies suffered a crushing defeat in the 1967 Arab\u2013Israeli war, the Soviets broke off diplomatic relations with Israel but increased their support of the Arabs, rebuilding Egyptian and Syrian armies virtually from scratch., The demands of security will have meant only a handful of people will have conceived and planned an operation which led to the deaths of more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and plunged the region into one of its deepest crises for many years. But if the apparent power such violence confers may explain the twisted attraction of terrorism for some, it does not explain why have we not found a means to inoculate ourselves against the disease. Because this is not how it seems to those who use terrorism to effect radical change, to disrupt a political process they oppose, force a country to change its policies and attitudes, to propagandise, radicalise and polarise, or simply terrorise., American power depends on preventing the emergence of a dominant   or a single power in the Gulf controlling the majority of the world\u2019s oil reserves. Washington had little time for French and German diplomatic protests against the illegal nature of the Iraq war. Against the backdrop of the Arab spring, in 2011 Barack Obama sent US forces back into action in Libya, without care for   at the UN security council, on a mission that drifted into an unannounced goal of regime change and a bloody civil war., Mr Biden is seeking to bring down energy prices and improve his dismal approval ratings as November\u2019s midterm elections approach \u2013 though the Saudis played down suggestions that they would start pumping more oil, giving him a poor return so far for the image detoxification he provided. Both sense that, despite Mr Biden\u2019s declaration that the US would not \u201cwalk away and leave a vacuum to be filled by China, Russia and India\u201d, the superpower\u2019s interest in the region is waning \u2013 while Mr Putin has   there again. The US has alleged that Iran plans to send Russia hundreds of drones to use in Ukraine, and Gazprom has just signed a development deal with the Iranian state oil company., Instead, this week the G7   pledges to halt fossil fuel investment over fears of winter energy shortages as Moscow squeezes supplies.  against Russia, even as they take a toll on the global economy, will cause ordinary Russians hardship. The havoc that Russia\u2019s war has caused on the world\u2019s energy markets is contributing to an economic crisis that is playing into the hands of Mr Biden\u2019s  . The US is pursuing a three-pronged  : increasing pressure on Russia; getting more oil into markets to bring prices down; and allowing   to raise interest rates to levels that look as if they might cause a recession."]]]}}},"view":{"type":"object","name":"CDSView","id":"p1069","attributes":{"filter":{"type":"object","name":"AllIndices","id":"p1070"}}},"glyph":{"type":"object","name":"Circle","id":"p1065","attributes":{"x":{"type":"field","field":"x"},"y":{"type":"field","field":"y"},"line_color":{"type":"value","value":"#1f77b4"},"fill_color":{"type":"value","value":"#1f77b4"}}},"nonselection_glyph":{"type":"object","name":"Circle","id":"p1066","attributes":{"x":{"type":"field","field":"x"},"y":{"type":"field","field":"y"},"line_color":{"type":"value","value":"#1f77b4"},"line_alpha":{"type":"value","value":0.1},"fill_color":{"type":"value","value":"#1f77b4"},"fill_alpha":{"type":"value","value":0.1},"hatch_alpha":{"type":"value","value":0.1}}},"muted_glyph":{"type":"object","name":"Circle","id":"p1067","attributes":{"x":{"type":"field","field":"x"},"y":{"type":"field","field":"y"},"line_color":{"type":"value","value":"#1f77b4"},"line_alpha":{"type":"value","value":0.2},"fill_color":{"type":"value","value":"#1f77b4"},"fill_alpha":{"type":"value","value":0.2},"hatch_alpha":{"type":"value","value":0.2}}}}}],"toolbar":{"type":"object","name":"Toolbar","id":"p1049","attributes":{"tools":[{"type":"object","name":"HoverTool","id":"p1039","attributes":{"renderers":"auto","tooltips":"\n        &lt;div style=\"width:200px;\"&gt;\n        @keywords\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        "}}]}},"left":[{"type":"object","name":"LinearAxis","id":"p1057","attributes":{"ticker":{"type":"object","name":"BasicTicker","id":"p1058","attributes":{"mantissas":[1,2,5]}},"formatter":{"type":"object","name":"BasicTickFormatter","id":"p1059"},"axis_label":"Mean Article Polarity","major_label_policy":{"type":"object","name":"AllLabels","id":"p1060"}}}],"below":[{"type":"object","name":"LinearAxis","id":"p1052","attributes":{"ticker":{"type":"object","name":"BasicTicker","id":"p1053","attributes":{"mantissas":[1,2,5]}},"formatter":{"type":"object","name":"BasicTickFormatter","id":"p1054"},"axis_label":"Cluster","major_label_policy":{"type":"object","name":"AllLabels","id":"p1055"}}}],"center":[{"type":"object","name":"Grid","id":"p1056","attributes":{"axis":{"id":"p1052"}}},{"type":"object","name":"Grid","id":"p1061","attributes":{"dimension":1,"axis":{"id":"p1057"}}}]}}]}}]}}
